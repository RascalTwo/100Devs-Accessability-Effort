1
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:07,958
Speaker 1: Thank you.

2
00:00:36,044 --> 00:00:38,626
Speaker 1: Welcome back to the Free Code Camp podcast.

3
00:00:38,766 --> 00:00:41,869
Speaker 1: I'm Quincy Larson teacher and founder of Free Code Camp.org.

4
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:47,854
Speaker 1: Each week, we're bringing you insight from developers, founders and ambitious people that are getting into tech.

5
00:00:48,094 --> 00:00:57,602
Speaker 1: Today, we're talking with Leon Noelle, who, I don't know if you've heard of 100 devs, but it's amazing and it's a huge source of inspiration for me personally.

6
00:00:58,003 --> 00:01:02,547
Speaker 1: He is the founder of 100 devs and he is head of engineering at Resilient Co.

7
00:01:03,956 --> 00:01:08,279
Speaker 1: Leon, joining us from sunny Los Angeles.

8
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:09,679
Speaker 1: How's it going with you?

9
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:10,720
Speaker 1: It's a little early.

10
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,821
Speaker 0: We'll see if this thing comes out.

11
00:01:11,901 --> 00:01:12,941
Speaker 0: Things are going well.

12
00:01:14,022 --> 00:01:16,403
Speaker 0: This is surreal experience.

13
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:20,486
Speaker 0: Thank you so much for having me and we'll get weird with it real quick.

14
00:01:22,087 --> 00:01:25,869
Speaker 0: I always joke that like my wife knows how serious I am.

15
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:38,840
Speaker 0: if your face is like the background of my like screens or I've had a picture of you on my desk for a little while so she knows if it's go time or not based off of like she's seeing you so well.

16
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,481
Speaker 0: it's honor.

17
00:01:39,501 --> 00:01:42,563
Speaker 0: it's a huge privilege like this is a dream come true for me.

18
00:01:42,864 --> 00:01:49,890
Speaker 0: you're a huge hero of mine and had done so much to help so many folks and you're who I want to be when I grow up so I really appreciate it.

19
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:50,951
Speaker 0: thanks for having me on.

20
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:54,392
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I just want to say that it's like very kind.

21
00:01:54,932 --> 00:01:57,415
Speaker 1: And I want to say that that goes both ways.

22
00:01:57,455 --> 00:02:04,061
Speaker 1: Like often when I'm feeling like a little bit low energy and I, you know, I don't know if I can get a lot done today.

23
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:12,790
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll just, you know, go and answer a bunch of emails and not do like curriculum design or You know I'll go into like the.

24
00:02:13,812 --> 00:02:15,393
Speaker 1: I'm like what would Leon do?

25
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:22,121
Speaker 1: he would dive in head first he would have so much energy overflowing and he would just go in there and get things done.

26
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:36,693
Speaker 1: and so yeah like I do think about you a lot when I'm just feeling low energy because I've watched your streams, and I've seen the amount of energy, both like literal energy like bursting, forth, and the positive energy that you bring to the community.

27
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:39,014
Speaker 1: So thank you for that.

28
00:02:39,094 --> 00:02:42,457
Speaker 1: And I'll make a little meme of Wolverine holding the picture.

29
00:02:42,477 --> 00:02:44,398
Speaker 0: And then there you go.

30
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,860
Speaker 1: We leave out holding the picture of me.

31
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,121
Speaker 1: I won't really do that, but like I just said, what did you said that?

32
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:50,522
Speaker 1: That's just so hot to do in my mind.

33
00:02:51,043 --> 00:02:52,744
Speaker 1: Because I love X-Men.

34
00:02:53,124 --> 00:02:55,266
Speaker 0: So, um, Leon.

35
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:57,227
Speaker 0: Did you see the new announcement?

36
00:02:57,227 --> 00:02:59,489
Speaker 0: 97.

37
00:02:59,489 --> 00:02:59,969
Speaker 0: What's happening?

38
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:02,491
Speaker 0: The redo in the old school cartoon.

39
00:03:03,272 --> 00:03:03,912
Speaker 0: Oh my goodness.

40
00:03:03,992 --> 00:03:05,033
Speaker 0: Like post professor.

41
00:03:05,053 --> 00:03:05,774
Speaker 0: Yeah, 90s Saturday morning.

42
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:11,077
Speaker 0: All right, no more everybody.

43
00:03:11,097 --> 00:03:12,818
Speaker 0: Stop the podcast and go watch the trail.

44
00:03:13,658 --> 00:03:14,299
Speaker 0: It's really good.

45
00:03:14,339 --> 00:03:15,039
Speaker 0: It looks really good.

46
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:16,640
Speaker 1: I will put a link to the trailer.

47
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:23,343
Speaker 0: Here's my eyes when there's a specific catchphrase that is said, but yeah.

48
00:03:23,363 --> 00:03:25,224
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm going to link to that.

49
00:03:25,564 --> 00:03:40,932
Speaker 1: We should watch that immediately after you finish watching this podcast interview because we've got a ton of advice that's practical and not just, you know, something that you can do to escape from your day that they experienced but to build up your day-to-day experience and accomplish your goals.

50
00:03:41,332 --> 00:03:59,784
Speaker 1: So Leon, before we dive into 100 devs and resilient coders and all the work you've done, I like to always start these interviews with more autobiographical stuff, just so people can have context into who you are, your lived experience, where you're coming from, and where you're heading, and things like that.

51
00:04:00,264 --> 00:04:13,334
Speaker 1: So maybe you could take it back to where you grew up, and what your earliest ambitions were as a kid, Yeah, so I grew up in Philly, definitely 100% of product of Philly.

52
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:18,476
Speaker 0: I was always kind of the very kind of tinkering, wanting to build type of kid.

53
00:04:19,297 --> 00:04:27,401
Speaker 0: I grew up with a huge household, a big family, all in one row home in South Philly, which was amazing.

54
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:34,325
Speaker 0: And I was blessed to have amazing libraries where I had access to computers and kid.

55
00:04:34,745 --> 00:04:42,073
Speaker 0: Tinker and build and I was really blessed to even have a lot of even just computer science education early throughout my life.

56
00:04:42,413 --> 00:04:49,300
Speaker 0: I had a Q-basic class in middle school where I would get a sailboat to go from one side of the screen to the other.

57
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,162
Speaker 0: I thought I had magical powers and yeah.

58
00:04:51,602 --> 00:04:55,123
Speaker 0: I was very lucky to have these skills so early.

59
00:04:55,143 --> 00:05:05,106
Speaker 0: We also infill have magnet schools, which are kind of like exams schools that you test into, and so I want to engineering in science, where I had two years of C++.

60
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,948
Speaker 0: in high school, and this is like 20 years ago.

61
00:05:09,488 --> 00:05:25,835
Speaker 0: And so, yeah, I just, I'm very lucky to have grown up in an environment that supported my passions and interest, even when I didn't have access to those technologies or knowledge that there was a way for me to get access to it.

62
00:05:25,895 --> 00:05:27,616
Speaker 0: So, very, very thankful for that.

63
00:05:28,357 --> 00:05:28,897
Speaker 1: That's awesome.

64
00:05:28,957 --> 00:05:37,121
Speaker 1: Yeah, it sounds like a really kind of like a dillic upbringing in the sense that like, you've got access.

65
00:05:37,762 --> 00:05:38,442
Speaker 1: What about teachers?

66
00:05:38,623 --> 00:05:41,865
Speaker 1: Did you have any teachers as a kid who like really propelled you forward?

67
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:50,512
Speaker 1: I always talked very passionately about my seventh grade teacher or eighth grade teacher, science teacher, Mr.

68
00:05:50,552 --> 00:05:53,434
Speaker 1: Krieger, whom I've failed to track down.

69
00:05:53,474 --> 00:05:54,735
Speaker 1: If you know Mr.

70
00:05:54,775 --> 00:06:04,683
Speaker 1: Krieger who taught at, you know, Hoover Middle School, which was like a now destroyed bulldozed school in Oklahoma City.

71
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,284
Speaker 1: If anybody has heard of that person, let me know.

72
00:06:07,364 --> 00:06:09,646
Speaker 1: But did you have anybody like a Mr.

73
00:06:09,706 --> 00:06:15,749
Speaker 1: Krieger in your life who was eccentric and interesting, but kept giving you like interesting books about space and stuff like that?

74
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:18,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I've have been lucky to have a few.

75
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:19,791
Speaker 0: So Mr.

76
00:06:19,931 --> 00:06:34,201
Speaker 0: and Sheen was my fifth grade teacher that when I was done my coursework would not let me just sit there totally my thumbs but always had like puzzles and things to build and tinker with in the background and I like what.

77
00:06:34,221 --> 00:06:35,183
Speaker 0: I've tried to find them.

78
00:06:35,203 --> 00:06:38,993
Speaker 0: I haven't been able to find them, but they really kind of showed me that.

79
00:06:40,256 --> 00:06:51,278
Speaker 0: I could be in control of my learning that it wasn't a one way to positive of knowledge that I could have some sort of control or command over the things I was doing with my free time.

80
00:06:51,358 --> 00:06:55,639
Speaker 0: that would enable me to think creatively and to do things I wanted to do.

81
00:06:55,659 --> 00:07:09,042
Speaker 0: I had a lot of wonderful folks throughout high school that really helped guide me that pushed me that maybe saw something inside of me that I didn't see inside of myself and would try and pull that out.

82
00:07:09,722 --> 00:07:12,584
Speaker 0: my, we're talking about, like, code education, shout out Mr.

83
00:07:12,624 --> 00:07:16,826
Speaker 0: Schipper would push me to learn my, my C++.

84
00:07:17,147 --> 00:07:28,233
Speaker 0: and we had the old school like matrix printers where you'd print out, yeah, hold on them and, and I'd look through it and take it to them and try to point out bugs or errors.

85
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:33,338
Speaker 0: and you talk about folks in your life that do like the small things right.

86
00:07:33,358 --> 00:07:34,259
Speaker 0: and mr.

87
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:39,463
Speaker 0: shipper every every birthday for years and years would just send me like a happy birthday message.

88
00:07:39,503 --> 00:08:10,765
Speaker 0: so talking about folks that just support you long term uh... that was there and then in university it was doctor bps guess the person that showed me that I could be what I wanted to be, and supported my ability to learn, and supported what I wanted to do, made sure that I had funding over the summer, to live, made sure that I got to do the research I wanted to do, and ultimately gave me the skills that I thought I needed to.

89
00:08:10,785 --> 00:08:18,408
Speaker 0: Either person I wanted to be in life, and so yeah, definitely the product of amazing teachers throughout my entire life.

90
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:25,031
Speaker 0: That's something that I try to think of with resilient coders and 100 devs.

91
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:34,196
Speaker 0: What was about those folks that inspired me to do more to learn to feel comfortable and trying to bring that into the classroom as well?

92
00:08:34,756 --> 00:08:46,889
Speaker 1: yeah yeah it's so cool to talk with another teacher because obviously your software engineer but you're also a teacher to many many people not necessarily in the conventional way maybe in the conventional way too.

93
00:08:46,969 --> 00:08:55,137
Speaker 1: maybe you actually give lectures occasionally in person but like through 100 devs you're essentially like the classroom teacher that people need.

94
00:08:55,598 --> 00:09:09,604
Speaker 1: you know like yeah You know, the VAT signals up in the air, the 100-dev signal and you're answering that call and you're helping people with the not just practical challenges of learning the code, but the motivational challenges as well.

95
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:12,665
Speaker 1: And that's a huge thing I take away from your stream.

96
00:09:13,425 --> 00:09:17,767
Speaker 1: Sounds like you went on to do really well academically.

97
00:09:17,787 --> 00:09:22,109
Speaker 1: I presume because you went to university in the world.

98
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:29,612
Speaker 1: Maybe you could talk a little bit about what that process was like, what is it like getting into a relatively elite school?

99
00:09:30,292 --> 00:09:33,374
Speaker 1: And was that?

100
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:35,715
Speaker 1: how long did you have that plan?

101
00:09:35,895 --> 00:09:36,935
Speaker 1: What age did you kind of like?

102
00:09:36,975 --> 00:09:37,876
Speaker 1: snap to awareness?

103
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:41,919
Speaker 1: I always like to tell people like I kind of snap to awareness much later in life.

104
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:53,689
Speaker 1: I was maybe like 20 21 and that's when I got really into like journalism and studying foreign languages and stuff like themes that would kind of run throughout the rest of life living abroad.

105
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:56,192
Speaker 1: and ultimately like much later I had kind of like.

106
00:09:56,232 --> 00:10:05,339
Speaker 1: second thing where I learned like technologies really really gosh darn useful like and that's when I learned to code and like automated stuff from my school and stuff.

107
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:18,748
Speaker 1: but like did you have like an early kind of awakening at some point you remember a distinct period of your life where you're like hey you know I can do a lot more than other people around me are doing my peers.

108
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:21,010
Speaker 1: what was there such an awakening?

109
00:10:22,391 --> 00:10:27,417
Speaker 0: yeah I think I want it to be comfortable.

110
00:10:27,437 --> 00:10:30,841
Speaker 0: I want it to have a good life.

111
00:10:31,301 --> 00:10:38,710
Speaker 0: And I think early on, especially as a kid of color, you're going to talk this very, it's just a doctor learned that this.

112
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,452
Speaker 0: It comes up over and over and over again.

113
00:10:40,472 --> 00:10:55,297
Speaker 0: And it comes from maybe our families and the folks in our community not knowing kind of all of the opportunities that are available, but those are the safe pathways, the doctor learned dentists and so.

114
00:10:55,317 --> 00:10:55,397
Speaker 0: Yeah.

115
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:59,683
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's proven.

116
00:10:59,703 --> 00:11:05,107
Speaker 0: So that's kind of the path that I got put on at someone that who was successful pretty early academically.

117
00:11:05,127 --> 00:11:06,967
Speaker 0: I did well in elementary school.

118
00:11:07,047 --> 00:11:12,389
Speaker 0: I got, I used to have to go from my school to another school every week to do like other programs.

119
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:20,233
Speaker 0: And I saw how hard my grandparents had to work.

120
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:26,015
Speaker 0: I saw how hard my grandfather works specifically in a boiler room every day.

121
00:11:26,055 --> 00:11:26,695
Speaker 0: It was hot.

122
00:11:26,775 --> 00:11:43,512
Speaker 0: They were pulling vows and I saw what hardware could do, and I wanted to do something that would enable me to have a good life, but maybe not be so sweaty.

123
00:11:44,893 --> 00:11:48,936
Speaker 0: And so the idea, let me look into Dr.

124
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:49,817
Speaker 0: Leridentis, Dr.

125
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:59,273
Speaker 0: Leridentis, As I went through middle school, I was very focused on getting into one of our magnet schools.

126
00:11:59,673 --> 00:12:04,775
Speaker 0: So Philly has some amazing schools that you kind of test in and it's more of like a lottery now too as well.

127
00:12:05,335 --> 00:12:06,775
Speaker 0: And I went to engineering and science.

128
00:12:07,095 --> 00:12:18,558
Speaker 0: And engineering and science was geared around getting folks into engineering and science and had tracks that you could follow and a really good placement rate into universities.

129
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:37,890
Speaker 0: For a while my sophomore junior senior year, pretty much every lunch period was spent with Miss Brown, who's my guidance counselor, and would make sure that I was getting access to everything I needed to do well academically and to get into really good schools.

130
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:42,173
Speaker 0: And coming from a low income family, it's really expensive.

131
00:12:42,313 --> 00:12:54,542
Speaker 0: So Miss Brown would make sure that I had vouchers for everything that I could take the SAT for free that I could apply to schools for free.

132
00:12:54,623 --> 00:12:59,845
Speaker 0: that would get me into all the best summer programs that could help me academically.

133
00:13:00,305 --> 00:13:02,527
Speaker 0: I was a did up or bound for a while.

134
00:13:03,467 --> 00:13:08,510
Speaker 0: Make sure I had access to things that I'd get in the calculators and things like that.

135
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:17,014
Speaker 0: And so my school, I owe a lot to in terms of getting me prepared for eventually, which I would go to as Yale.

136
00:13:17,474 --> 00:13:49,754
Speaker 0: And so for me, I think I've just been really blessed to be the product of a school system that if I wanted it, if I wanted to work hard, if I wanted to put in the hours and I played through sports, I did every club imaginable, but I had really amazing people that guided me through that process, and then I was able to make it from in us into Yale and then went into hard sciences and was on this track to be a doctor, right?

137
00:13:50,354 --> 00:13:50,615
Speaker 0: Dr.

138
00:13:50,635 --> 00:13:52,016
Speaker 0: Larry Dentist, I chose Dr.

139
00:13:52,036 --> 00:14:04,623
Speaker 0: My mom was an LPN and I got to grow up in doctors offices and see and talk to folks and that was kind of the path that was on.

140
00:14:04,683 --> 00:14:19,389
Speaker 0: and it's kind of funny because I was doing computer science, I was in an engineering high school and I just didn't allow myself to see that as my path or my career even though that's where I eventually I should have been or eventually did make it to.

141
00:14:19,789 --> 00:14:22,030
Speaker 0: and so that's kind of the long-wine path.

142
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:27,475
Speaker 1: and to Awesome, and LPN is licensed practitioner, licensed practicing nurse?

143
00:14:27,956 --> 00:14:30,339
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like a vocational nurse, basically.

144
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:38,649
Speaker 0: So instead of doing, now I guess the track is like your bachelor's and you get like your RN, this was a vocational pathway to being a nurse.

145
00:14:39,591 --> 00:14:52,195
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I just want to make sure I got that right, and I have like this policy that like no matter how common the acronym is, I always try to like spell it out for especially for our listeners abroad, not even being the speaker of listeners as well.

146
00:14:52,255 --> 00:14:56,396
Speaker 1: So okay, so just recapitulate some of that.

147
00:14:56,416 --> 00:15:02,398
Speaker 1: I've been telling you to tell this as you talk just because this is so interesting and I'll email these to myself.

148
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:05,599
Speaker 1: These are not properly, but it's basically the contents of this conversation.

149
00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:06,200
Speaker 1: It's public now.

150
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:11,541
Speaker 1: it sounds like you didn't.

151
00:15:11,641 --> 00:15:12,441
Speaker 1: it just didn't even click.

152
00:15:12,461 --> 00:15:32,455
Speaker 1: it didn't even really occur to you that software engineering was a field you could go into because like so many people coming from underprivileged backgrounds so many you know second generation and we're going to start even first generation and we're going so many people growing up who are kind of still in the shadow of inequality like racial inequality.

153
00:15:32,575 --> 00:15:33,555
Speaker 1: that's systemic.

154
00:15:33,675 --> 00:15:34,996
Speaker 1: that is the reason.

155
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:43,463
Speaker 1: one of the reasons why you know wealth among black families is like Something like one tenth of like white families that have been in the U.S.

156
00:15:43,503 --> 00:15:44,524
Speaker 1: the same duration of time.

157
00:15:44,564 --> 00:15:45,485
Speaker 1: I mean, it's like ridiculous.

158
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:51,310
Speaker 1: But because of these circumstances, uh, you were pushed to do Dr.

159
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:56,834
Speaker 1: lawyer dentist, and again, like most of my doctors dentists

160
00:15:57,395 --> 00:15:57,555
Speaker 0: that

161
00:15:57,655 --> 00:16:24,888
Speaker 1: I haven't had any lawyers lately, like over the years have been people who came from a different country, like their parents came from a different country, or in many cases, as doctors, they literally came from India past the USMLE, which is this incredibly stringent test, essentially re-certified as doctors, a very lengthy costly process, just so they could practice in the US, because the US is like a great place to live, and it's a great place to work as a physician.

162
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:27,252
Speaker 1: generally I guess I shouldn't speak for all.

163
00:16:27,272 --> 00:16:33,843
Speaker 1: there may be some positions in the audience who take issue with that because of regulatory issues and like all this other stuff.

164
00:16:34,263 --> 00:16:42,407
Speaker 1: but My point is you were so focused on that because that is what success sounded like.

165
00:16:42,927 --> 00:16:47,430
Speaker 1: That was like the family's perception of success and software engineers like a relatively new thing.

166
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:53,614
Speaker 1: that is not well understood and it's not a surprise because software engineers only existed a few decades.

167
00:16:53,774 --> 00:17:12,515
Speaker 1: Maybe you could talk about like What that awakening to software engineering was like, and how you went about, okay, I'm gonna go much deeper on coding and learning about computer science and math, like all these things that you need to be a successful software engineer.

168
00:17:13,776 --> 00:17:18,178
Speaker 1: Now now I you may take issue with me saying like you need a whole lot of math for example or something like that.

169
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:24,702
Speaker 1: I don't think that's necessary true for a lot of jobs but I always tell people like there is no knowledge that is not power.

170
00:17:24,842 --> 00:17:27,823
Speaker 1: like you should definitely learn math if you have the time.

171
00:17:27,903 --> 00:17:30,725
Speaker 1: it's probably not the highest priority if you just want to go get a job as a developer.

172
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,753
Speaker 1: Sorry, but my question for you.

173
00:17:33,274 --> 00:17:33,614
Speaker 1: Leon.

174
00:17:34,614 --> 00:17:36,055
Speaker 1: All right, complete introduction.

175
00:17:36,616 --> 00:17:36,956
Speaker 1: Right on.

176
00:17:37,076 --> 00:17:45,802
Speaker 1: Okay, so I'm glad to hear that like, yeah, because a lot of times I hear like, I think one of the pieces of misinformation that's going around is like, oh, you don't need math to be a developer.

177
00:17:46,242 --> 00:17:47,323
Speaker 1: Like, I don't know any math.

178
00:17:47,343 --> 00:17:49,164
Speaker 1: Like, I just took high school math and I'm a developer.

179
00:17:49,565 --> 00:17:55,168
Speaker 1: And like, That is true to an extent, but there is kind of like a ceiling that you're going to hit in your engineering career.

180
00:17:55,188 --> 00:17:55,368
Speaker 1: Yeah.

181
00:17:55,588 --> 00:18:02,311
Speaker 1: If you don't like at least take some time to learn some mathematics and you can learn mathematics right here on free code camps, YouTube channel.

182
00:18:02,732 --> 00:18:10,256
Speaker 1: We have courses on pretty much every engineering math topic that you would learn at like an undergraduate engineering program.

183
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:14,358
Speaker 1: So, you know, it's just investment of time.

184
00:18:14,418 --> 00:18:19,921
Speaker 1: And that's a big thing we'll talk about in a little bit is like, is it really free in the sense that you have to invest your time and energy.

185
00:18:20,401 --> 00:18:23,463
Speaker 1: And not everybody has equal time and energy.

186
00:18:23,483 --> 00:18:28,245
Speaker 1: Some people have all kinds of different circumstances that inform their availability of the learning to code.

187
00:18:28,725 --> 00:18:29,986
Speaker 1: So, we'll talk about that in a minute.

188
00:18:30,006 --> 00:18:36,690
Speaker 1: But like, how did you, a person, and like, maybe how old were you, were you still in school when you realized that you wanted to do CS?

189
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:42,761
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I, was always building.

190
00:18:43,521 --> 00:18:50,705
Speaker 0: So when I started in sixth grade, I learned Q-basic and I would go to the libraries and tinker and build.

191
00:18:50,745 --> 00:18:57,308
Speaker 0: When I was in high school, upper bound got me a TI-83 plus calculator, which I still have.

192
00:18:57,348 --> 00:18:58,989
Speaker 0: It's like in my drawer over here somewhere.

193
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:03,192
Speaker 0: You could write code for that calculator.

194
00:19:03,572 --> 00:19:05,113
Speaker 0: And I remember swapping.

195
00:19:05,153 --> 00:19:06,274
Speaker 0: I felt like it was like old school.

196
00:19:06,294 --> 00:19:08,135
Speaker 0: You know, like how you people used to swap flopbies.

197
00:19:08,255 --> 00:19:14,379
Speaker 0: I would swap the games and programs from the calculator and go to the library.

198
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:24,966
Speaker 0: And like I remember the thing I wanted for one Christmas was like the cable that connected the calculator to the computer so that I could like put my code on it.

199
00:19:25,086 --> 00:19:36,837
Speaker 0: And so I remember very early working on calculator games and other fun stuff that I just went to bring into the world or modify and hack God and so that was always really fun.

200
00:19:36,857 --> 00:19:44,524
Speaker 0: And then I had that kind of formal C++ in high school and then when I got to university, it all went out the window.

201
00:19:44,544 --> 00:19:45,946
Speaker 0: I was doing hard biology.

202
00:19:45,966 --> 00:19:49,429
Speaker 0: I was doing eventually biological anthropology.

203
00:19:49,469 --> 00:19:52,032
Speaker 0: I was looking at hormones, testosterone, and stuff like that.

204
00:19:52,552 --> 00:19:57,858
Speaker 0: But this entire time I'd always been building, tinkering, I really liked entrepreneurship.

205
00:19:58,178 --> 00:20:02,462
Speaker 0: I was always trying to start ideas, small companies, things like that.

206
00:20:02,562 --> 00:20:13,053
Speaker 0: And I had started one simple project that went pretty viral in New Haven, New York area.

207
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:25,239
Speaker 0: And that kind of really showed me some of the power of these skills that I had been kind of accumulating, but the real kind of awakening for me for computer science was every summer I was doing lab work.

208
00:20:25,699 --> 00:20:35,864
Speaker 0: And I had figured out how to survive when you're low income going into an Ivy League school, basically they give you a full ride right out the rip.

209
00:20:36,024 --> 00:20:48,611
Speaker 0: And so I had figured out that if I didn't live on campus, they would give me like whatever the amount of money was to stay on campus they would give me and I was able to use that to like do stuff.

210
00:20:48,671 --> 00:20:58,297
Speaker 0: I would pay rent and food but I was happy eating pasta and pasta sauce and I actually hadn't money to like live and and do all the things that all my my fellow students were doing.

211
00:20:58,397 --> 00:21:06,221
Speaker 0: because I figured out this like way of doing it but I ran out of money whatsoever and it was getting pretty dicey pretty quickly.

212
00:21:06,322 --> 00:21:14,645
Speaker 0: I really didn't have any money for food left and I was literally hungry and I realized that I could do things like.

213
00:21:14,805 --> 00:21:19,306
Speaker 0: I was looking up like put jobs and then I was like wait a minute let me let me see if I can build somebody at website.

214
00:21:19,366 --> 00:21:19,966
Speaker 0: I know how to do it.

215
00:21:19,986 --> 00:21:23,607
Speaker 0: I've been building all these like landing pages and in small things with code before.

216
00:21:24,107 --> 00:21:25,308
Speaker 0: so I put on Craigslist.

217
00:21:25,348 --> 00:21:26,348
Speaker 0: hey I'll build GSA.

218
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,528
Speaker 0: I can get it done today.

219
00:21:27,548 --> 00:21:31,950
Speaker 0: and somebody responded and they paid a deposit.

220
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:36,373
Speaker 0: and My life changed from that moment.

221
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:38,595
Speaker 0: I skipped all the way to the grocery store.

222
00:21:38,955 --> 00:21:41,517
Speaker 0: I bought my pasta, bought my pasta sauce for the month.

223
00:21:42,138 --> 00:21:49,303
Speaker 0: I built them this site and in that moment something very clear happened in my brain that I had a real skill.

224
00:21:50,264 --> 00:21:54,447
Speaker 0: A skill that can provide, that can put food on the table, a skill that would.

225
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:57,731
Speaker 0: make it so I was never fucking hungry again.

226
00:21:57,751 --> 00:21:58,531
Speaker 0: Sorry, oops, sorry, Chris.

227
00:21:58,992 --> 00:21:59,552
Speaker 1: It's cool.

228
00:21:59,572 --> 00:22:00,492
Speaker 0: I get it again.

229
00:22:00,912 --> 00:22:01,493
Speaker 1: Yeah.

230
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:04,374
Speaker 1: If anybody like, like, we don't edit this podcast at all.

231
00:22:04,394 --> 00:22:05,914
Speaker 1: So I'm like, that's where it was.

232
00:22:05,954 --> 00:22:10,216
Speaker 1: That's like a, unless there's like something really bad that happens like I had a coughing film once.

233
00:22:13,137 --> 00:22:17,719
Speaker 0: And so that that changed everything until this day I stole freelance.

234
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:34,926
Speaker 0: And I, that's the reason why a lot of the things I do today, the, the resilient coders, the 100 does is like, I want anybody that has ever felt that way to know that there is this option, this ability to develop skills that no one can take away from you, that can put legitimate food on the table.

235
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:38,728
Speaker 0: And so that's when I kind of went all in on more of the engineering piece.

236
00:22:40,396 --> 00:22:41,337
Speaker 1: awesome yeah.

237
00:22:41,557 --> 00:22:49,565
Speaker 1: well um that sounds like an amazing discovery of like powers that you just had latent within you that necessity brought forth.

238
00:22:49,665 --> 00:22:52,247
Speaker 1: you know necessity is the mother of invention right?

239
00:22:52,568 --> 00:22:56,952
Speaker 1: uh you were forced to basically buy your circumstance to like.

240
00:22:57,112 --> 00:23:01,256
Speaker 1: think outside the proverbial box come up with a way to to get money to buy your pasta.

241
00:23:01,936 --> 00:23:06,880
Speaker 1: Um, I, you know, I definitely remember the lean cause.

242
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,521
Speaker 1: you're subsisting off pasta.

243
00:23:08,881 --> 00:23:10,102
Speaker 1: We got the smack ramen.

244
00:23:10,262 --> 00:23:14,945
Speaker 1: If anybody, like, not the good, like, hit ramen, like, Korean ramen, but like, it was just called smack.

245
00:23:16,386 --> 00:23:17,467
Speaker 1: We don't always joke about it.

246
00:23:17,547 --> 00:23:24,811
Speaker 1: Like, when you're hungry, you know, it's almost like, you know, like a drug because it's just like, you feel so sated afterward.

247
00:23:24,832 --> 00:23:26,753
Speaker 1: Um, it's like terrible for you.

248
00:23:27,193 --> 00:23:29,134
Speaker 1: But what kind of pasta did you always do?

249
00:23:29,354 --> 00:23:32,396
Speaker 1: Like, did you have a particular like build of pasta that you liked?

250
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:36,559
Speaker 0: Uh, this is like way back, whatever the cheapest was.

251
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:38,280
Speaker 0: I was, I was, I was, I'm gonna survive.

252
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:38,820
Speaker 0: I didn't care.

253
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:47,245
Speaker 0: Nowadays, I have some preferences, but back then, whatever, whatever it was on sale, whatever it was the cheapest, there was the supermarket nearest had like this like clearance aisle.

254
00:23:47,725 --> 00:23:50,287
Speaker 0: And in that clearance aisle, they would put like this stuff they couldn't sell.

255
00:23:50,447 --> 00:23:52,628
Speaker 0: And so whatever it was on that rack is what I had.

256
00:23:54,301 --> 00:23:55,381
Speaker 0: Yeah,

257
00:23:55,902 --> 00:24:09,626
Speaker 1: and to this day by the way, like a lot of grocery stores like Walmart, like they'll take their baked goods and they'll put them on a rack like right by the exit like the staff only place where they have like the garbage compactor where they compact the boxes like I worked in grocery stores for a few years.

258
00:24:10,066 --> 00:24:17,829
Speaker 1: so basically back where they keep all the mobs and they keep all the you know inventory helps that there will be like a little rack and sometimes they'll have big good that like

259
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:18,570
Speaker 0: it's still

260
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:21,851
Speaker 1: good but we can't really sell it because it's gonna expire like a day or two.

261
00:24:21,931 --> 00:24:24,652
Speaker 1: so like I still snag some buttons from there.

262
00:24:25,793 --> 00:24:34,277
Speaker 1: but yeah just pro tip if you're going to a US grocery store you can often find like food that's about to expire that you can get like at a discount.

263
00:24:35,257 --> 00:24:36,958
Speaker 1: So that's really cool.

264
00:24:36,998 --> 00:24:38,699
Speaker 1: So how do things unfold from there?

265
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:48,226
Speaker 1: So how did you go from that first contract work, essentially, that client that you landed through Craigslist, which is how I landed.

266
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:49,887
Speaker 1: I think I landed some early clients through Craigslist.

267
00:24:49,927 --> 00:24:51,148
Speaker 1: Craigslist, amazing tool.

268
00:24:51,168 --> 00:24:55,831
Speaker 1: I'm not sure if it's still amazing today, like 12 years since I last used it.

269
00:24:55,871 --> 00:24:59,753
Speaker 1: But yeah, like a lot of early gigs were found on Craigslist.

270
00:25:00,294 --> 00:25:03,395
Speaker 1: How did you go from that to the deciding?

271
00:25:03,415 --> 00:25:08,676
Speaker 1: I am a death like taking that identity if you will and going deeper with it.

272
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:09,957
Speaker 0: Yeah, sure.

273
00:25:10,097 --> 00:25:19,238
Speaker 0: So my junior year at Yale, I started a small website called Listful of Hope.

274
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:26,000
Speaker 0: It was kind of like a reverse Craigslist where if you needed something, you could say what you needed.

275
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:30,481
Speaker 0: So if you needed a jacket and someone in the area had a jacket, you would meet up and they would give you a jacket.

276
00:25:30,561 --> 00:25:31,981
Speaker 0: So it was kind of like a gift economy.

277
00:25:32,641 --> 00:25:37,482
Speaker 0: It was a very simple site that was just enabling folks to help others in their community.

278
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:41,043
Speaker 0: And it really kind of popped off in New Haven.

279
00:25:41,423 --> 00:25:44,724
Speaker 0: And so there is the one winter where it was like really popular.

280
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:48,925
Speaker 0: I remember people getting Christmas present, jackets, gloves, anything you needed.

281
00:25:49,706 --> 00:25:58,128
Speaker 0: And I could really see that transition from something that was like just a raw skill to like me having to build an actual application and having really users.

282
00:25:59,168 --> 00:26:07,092
Speaker 0: I was like I could I saw the power I saw that it could help so many people and I knew that these skills would be really advantageous to keep going.

283
00:26:07,112 --> 00:26:09,913
Speaker 0: and so my junior year I kind of slowly stopped.

284
00:26:11,004 --> 00:26:12,826
Speaker 0: kind of really wanting to do coursework.

285
00:26:13,586 --> 00:26:30,320
Speaker 0: Senior year, it became even bigger problem and I was trying to finish my thesis to graduate and I had to get like 300 men to spit in a tube, tell me about their sexual histories, I could correlate it to their testosterone levels.

286
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:39,768
Speaker 0: I was trying to like show that or find something about BPA in relation to the costumes and we drank a lot of, like, it's the classic models.

287
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:40,609
Speaker 0: Yeah.

288
00:26:40,949 --> 00:26:44,973
Speaker 0: And so I was trying to do that before it, before it became really popular, like, something people would actually think about.

289
00:26:45,013 --> 00:26:50,597
Speaker 1: Yeah, for you, plastic, which for the kids, like just in case, it does have, like, deleterious effects.

290
00:26:50,637 --> 00:26:51,838
Speaker 1: We don't want our kids to be drinking.

291
00:26:52,039 --> 00:27:05,395
Speaker 0: And so, really hard time running that that experiment and apparently people didn't want to, you know, spit into tube and tell me about their sexual history for a like a bottle of gatoria and like a package on or something.

292
00:27:05,456 --> 00:27:38,738
Speaker 0: And so I wasn't able to recruit enough people for that experiment and I decided to use my coding skills to set up just like a landing page where a lot of students were always trying to find studies or experiments to participate in because when they were a lot of fun sometimes and you actually got paid pretty well to do the experiments and so There is one really famous one that people loved where you basically went to a lab, they got you drunk and you played poker and they're just like watching you like how you make risky decisions and things like that and you got paid a couple of dollars to do it.

293
00:27:39,439 --> 00:27:48,608
Speaker 0: So I made a landing page that had all the studies from Yale, Harvard, Princeton that we're like trying to get people to come and I just slipped mine in there.

294
00:27:49,489 --> 00:27:52,813
Speaker 0: And it took off because we had all these professors that were promoting it.

295
00:27:53,093 --> 00:27:54,815
Speaker 0: We had all these students that got real value.

296
00:27:54,855 --> 00:27:55,656
Speaker 0: They went to the site.

297
00:27:55,696 --> 00:27:56,758
Speaker 0: They found something fun to do.

298
00:27:56,818 --> 00:28:03,365
Speaker 0: They got money and I dropped out my senior year to turn that into a business.

299
00:28:04,546 --> 00:28:06,287
Speaker 0: which became social science.

300
00:28:07,168 --> 00:28:10,590
Speaker 0: We wound up building academic surveying tools.

301
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:15,933
Speaker 0: They have over 4,000 different universities that used our tools to power their academic research.

302
00:28:16,573 --> 00:28:23,497
Speaker 0: And even though that company has been wrapped up for a long time now, we still have research that gets published based off of the data that they collect it.

303
00:28:24,018 --> 00:28:26,299
Speaker 0: I need it to know more.

304
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:36,423
Speaker 0: My engineers had these like magical powers and I needed to learn that skill for myself and so I took my cutting education more seriously.

305
00:28:37,203 --> 00:28:47,127
Speaker 0: Eventually I was building other products, other striaps as well and started teaching at General Assembly, helping others kind of acquire these skills too.

306
00:28:47,187 --> 00:28:48,508
Speaker 0: So that was kind of the journey.

307
00:28:49,108 --> 00:28:49,708
Speaker 1: And it's interesting.

308
00:28:49,748 --> 00:28:54,670
Speaker 1: So first of all, congratulations on building something that 4000 universities.

309
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:54,990
Speaker 1: Yeah.

310
00:28:55,371 --> 00:28:58,012
Speaker 1: It's not easy to get universities to use your stuff.

311
00:28:58,472 --> 00:29:03,634
Speaker 1: There's like this notorious like sales cycle adoption cycle among universities.

312
00:29:03,674 --> 00:29:06,875
Speaker 1: They're very like slow to adopt new tools.

313
00:29:06,895 --> 00:29:09,396
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, that's that's phenomenal.

314
00:29:09,436 --> 00:29:19,377
Speaker 1: To go from basically like mechanical torque for being a human test subject to having like an actual project that is getting wide usage.

315
00:29:19,537 --> 00:29:21,598
Speaker 1: Like, that's really amazing.

316
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,018
Speaker 0: Bring up mechanical Turk.

317
00:29:23,078 --> 00:29:29,381
Speaker 0: Those are the reason why we were able to raise like VC funding was because M Turk was becoming more popular.

318
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:31,262
Speaker 0: And what social size.

319
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:37,704
Speaker 0: soft was not just the survey creation, but the participants taking the surveys.

320
00:29:38,244 --> 00:29:43,827
Speaker 0: And so part of my pitch deck and I'll know if I get it was I decided to get my mom a Christmas card.

321
00:29:44,187 --> 00:29:56,993
Speaker 0: And I had people on M Turk like just like hold up the Merry Christmas sign and what we had was this one person with a hundred different like not a hundred but like a lot of different accounts.

322
00:29:57,273 --> 00:30:08,506
Speaker 0: that was just like changing their hat putting on a different shirt but it was like clearly the same person and so at this point the kind of took had it solved the like identity online and like how do you stop?

323
00:30:08,886 --> 00:30:10,047
Speaker 0: like false participants?

324
00:30:10,087 --> 00:30:20,076
Speaker 0: and that was kind of why we were able to be able to raise money and why we were able to have so many universities trust and use our service because we were solving that problem specifically.

325
00:30:20,472 --> 00:30:22,793
Speaker 1: So what's your mom like, who is this person and where is this?

326
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:26,674
Speaker 1: So, you know, passionate about like, we should be happy with it.

327
00:30:26,734 --> 00:30:27,434
Speaker 1: It was cool.

328
00:30:27,474 --> 00:30:35,336
Speaker 0: There's like a hundred people from all over the world with like different backgrounds, different cities, different places, and they all were saying Merry Christmas.

329
00:30:35,596 --> 00:30:36,116
Speaker 0: Merry Christmas.

330
00:30:36,156 --> 00:30:39,877
Speaker 0: I like to facilitate that, but back when we did it, it was pretty cool.

331
00:30:40,856 --> 00:30:47,158
Speaker 1: yeah and make mechanical turk just for people that are unfamiliar with it is like they call it artificial artificial intelligence.

332
00:30:47,699 --> 00:30:51,660
Speaker 1: it obviously nowadays like a lot of things you would pay someone on mechanical the turk to do.

333
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:56,882
Speaker 1: you just like format to like an all-embers something but it was like um... like.

334
00:30:56,902 --> 00:30:58,863
Speaker 1: hey I need you like early on.

335
00:30:58,883 --> 00:31:01,203
Speaker 1: it was like hey I need you to solve a capture for me.

336
00:31:01,364 --> 00:31:05,905
Speaker 1: or yeah I need you to create a Facebook account and like like this this Facebook group or something like that.

337
00:31:05,925 --> 00:31:10,688
Speaker 1: it was like basically getting around the restrictions, the different platforms might have in place.

338
00:31:11,589 --> 00:31:20,956
Speaker 1: But, you know, in the good, like, as designed use would be, for example, getting people to do precisely what they had said.

339
00:31:21,056 --> 00:31:25,000
Speaker 1: So it was everybody would get, like, maybe just a few pennies.

340
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:32,385
Speaker 1: for doing a hit, I think, or a job or something, I can't remember what they were called, but yeah, you would do those.

341
00:31:32,985 --> 00:31:33,585
Speaker 1: Is that accurate?

342
00:31:33,605 --> 00:31:34,946
Speaker 1: Like, I haven't actually used it.

343
00:31:35,006 --> 00:31:36,287
Speaker 0: No, that's that's pretty close.

344
00:31:36,908 --> 00:31:40,430
Speaker 0: There was, it's this whole subfield called human computation, right?

345
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:52,339
Speaker 0: So there's there's Some things that computers can't yet do, that humans can still do, but figuring out how to do them at scale, is really important.

346
00:31:52,359 --> 00:32:00,466
Speaker 0: And so, mechanical Turk, you can take a task, break it down into a very small sub-task and have thousands of thousands of people do it.

347
00:32:01,047 --> 00:32:05,290
Speaker 0: Need for human competition is like labeling data, think of AI training, and it's like that.

348
00:32:06,451 --> 00:32:07,652
Speaker 0: There had to be real.

349
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:15,620
Speaker 0: people that said that was a a fire hose or that was a part that was a bicycle and you know what and not a muffin.

350
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:26,996
Speaker 0: that's like a famous like you always look a lot like muffins to a computer and so figuring out all of that was necessary for a lot of the advanceers that we're seeing now.

351
00:32:27,356 --> 00:32:31,360
Speaker 0: And there are still things that humans can do very quickly that machines just can't do yet.

352
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,863
Speaker 0: And so M.Turk still has a place.

353
00:32:34,883 --> 00:32:41,569
Speaker 0: There are other companies that do similar things nowadays, of course, but that labeling and small tasks done at scale.

354
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:50,080
Speaker 0: And there are other cool things you can do too, so where it's like It's that giving it to just one person you give it to five and a four out of the five do one thing.

355
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:55,467
Speaker 0: You know that you can probably trust that thing is opposed to the one person that did it as opposed to the minority report.

356
00:32:56,068 --> 00:32:58,792
Speaker 1: Yeah dissenting dissenting opinion.

357
00:32:58,812 --> 00:33:01,136
Speaker 1: Yeah, that that's a good kind of consensus mechanism.

358
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,397
Speaker 1: So um, okay cool.

359
00:33:03,498 --> 00:33:04,378
Speaker 1: So you built this project.

360
00:33:04,678 --> 00:33:07,421
Speaker 1: We could talk about that a lot more, but we have so much more to talk about.

361
00:33:07,561 --> 00:33:07,781
Speaker 1: Yeah.

362
00:33:07,801 --> 00:33:08,862
Speaker 1: Like where do you go from there?

363
00:33:08,902 --> 00:33:12,565
Speaker 1: You you basically had a successful project, right?

364
00:33:12,585 --> 00:33:15,007
Speaker 1: Like everybody's dream, especially at this point.

365
00:33:15,367 --> 00:33:16,368
Speaker 1: Sounds like you were pretty strong.

366
00:33:16,948 --> 00:33:17,428
Speaker 1: Like yeah.

367
00:33:17,488 --> 00:33:19,490
Speaker 1: Like, like, had you finished college at this point?

368
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:22,072
Speaker 0: Like I, so I dropped out and never finished.

369
00:33:22,532 --> 00:33:22,893
Speaker 1: Oh, wow.

370
00:33:23,473 --> 00:33:24,995
Speaker 0: and my senior year at Yale.

371
00:33:25,896 --> 00:33:27,638
Speaker 0: I had this idea for social side.

372
00:33:28,099 --> 00:33:28,799
Speaker 0: I dropped out.

373
00:33:28,879 --> 00:33:30,001
Speaker 0: I did tech stars.

374
00:33:30,021 --> 00:33:32,263
Speaker 1: Tech stars and accelerator.

375
00:33:32,764 --> 00:33:33,785
Speaker 0: Yeah, popular.

376
00:33:33,865 --> 00:33:38,290
Speaker 1: Like they give you some some seed money and then you're in like a program where they kind of coach you.

377
00:33:38,991 --> 00:33:39,291
Speaker 0: Exactly.

378
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:39,611
Speaker 1: Exactly.

379
00:33:39,631 --> 00:33:40,192
Speaker 1: They help you.

380
00:33:40,292 --> 00:33:40,892
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

381
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:41,852
Speaker 0: They help you.

382
00:33:42,032 --> 00:33:47,515
Speaker 0: Lay the foundation for a company and all the skills you might need to know to do that effectively.

383
00:33:48,095 --> 00:33:49,556
Speaker 0: Textaries really changed my life.

384
00:33:49,636 --> 00:33:51,737
Speaker 0: It really gave me a lot of the skills that I was missing.

385
00:33:52,477 --> 00:34:00,681
Speaker 0: Give me my initial network outside of university and yeah, the initial seed funding and then help me go on to raise more funds for for social science.

386
00:34:01,101 --> 00:34:15,033
Speaker 0: Yeah, while I was running social-side, I started teaching at General Assembly, and so General Assembly was one of the first really big coding bootcamp programs, and I was doing their part-time courses for a very long time.

387
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:23,847
Speaker 0: I'm a distinguished faculty with GA, even till today, and I was having just hundreds, if not thousands of people.

388
00:34:23,927 --> 00:34:43,799
Speaker 0: be successful, like learning these new skills, learning how to code, getting great jobs, and at one point it kind of just got overwhelming that I didn't notice anyone that looked like me taking advantage of this program, one because it cost a lot of money, that also cost a lot of time.

389
00:34:43,819 --> 00:34:52,463
Speaker 0: So I started looking for orgs near me in Boston that I could help or support.

390
00:34:52,603 --> 00:35:07,553
Speaker 0: And I came across resilient coders, which at that time, our founder David Delmar, I was really trying to work with court-involved youth and show them, hey, like, there are these things you can be doing like coding or things like that that might help you long-term in life.

391
00:35:08,053 --> 00:35:22,981
Speaker 0: I started just going to, we had what are called community hours where it was just myself, a few other mentors and a bunch of young folks that particularly court involved or returning citizen and just trying to like give them these skills.

392
00:35:23,141 --> 00:35:28,182
Speaker 0: and then we had the idea of starting a boot camp.

393
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:35,404
Speaker 0: and our founder Dave Delmar said hey like you've been running these other boot camp programs could you do it for our sea?

394
00:35:35,764 --> 00:35:36,284
Speaker 0: said yes.

395
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:54,088
Speaker 0: and then for the past six years we've built a program that can help folks traditionally of color that have particularly not completed a degree, though from zero to employable as a software engineer and we've been pretty successful at it.

396
00:35:54,108 --> 00:36:05,813
Speaker 0: We've helped hundreds of folks get jobs and with starting salaries around $92,000 and for us that's huge because For each person, we can get from those communities.

397
00:36:06,193 --> 00:36:11,037
Speaker 0: We're talking about millions and millions of dollars back into those communities over the lifespan of their career.

398
00:36:11,117 --> 00:36:13,939
Speaker 0: So it's not even doing resilient colors.

399
00:36:13,979 --> 00:36:16,301
Speaker 0: that adventure led me to a hundred devs and that's kind of the.

400
00:36:16,521 --> 00:36:17,421
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

401
00:36:17,822 --> 00:36:21,384
Speaker 1: I want to dive a little more into because we're going to talk a lot about 100 devs.

402
00:36:21,424 --> 00:36:25,447
Speaker 1: But like, uh, resulting in coders, you said, uh, court involved youth.

403
00:36:26,248 --> 00:36:53,776
Speaker 1: Uh, I'm not familiar with firm, but like, you know, I have lots of friends who are like convicted felons and you're not sure if that if that is essentially like people who early on in life get into trouble maybe because they actually did something wrong or maybe they were profiled and like the the very unequal justice system in the United States didn't do it's job very well and and you know gave them much hardship penalty that kids should probably have in many cases.

404
00:36:54,736 --> 00:36:58,702
Speaker 1: but Is that like accurately like yeah,

405
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:08,350
Speaker 0: so we had a lot of individuals that we say court involved because exactly the things that you brought up a lot of the folks that we were working with they didn't do anything

406
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:08,650
Speaker 1: wrong

407
00:37:09,571 --> 00:37:10,992
Speaker 0: and they were just the wrong place the

408
00:37:11,032 --> 00:37:11,653
Speaker 1: wrong time.

409
00:37:11,673 --> 00:37:27,847
Speaker 0: we did have folks that Had gone down a different path in life to do the things they need to do provide for themselves and their families and so we wanted to give them a clear path forward to do the the thing that I love ones and so we're trying to get them skills.

410
00:37:27,928 --> 00:37:38,459
Speaker 0: It's just skills that they can put into practice to get to a point where they had a strong stable high-growth career and then that's that's kind of the birth of RC.

411
00:37:39,901 --> 00:37:58,138
Speaker 0: And our dirty little secret that I guess some folks know is that the first dollars we ever took in were from the Boston Police Department, because they saw our program as, hey, we're going to spend all this money on incarceration, rehabilitation, why not get ahead of it?

412
00:37:58,799 --> 00:38:01,021
Speaker 0: And they have some funding to help one of our first bootcamp.

413
00:38:01,874 --> 00:38:02,734
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's awesome.

414
00:38:03,395 --> 00:38:09,338
Speaker 1: Well, it sounds like there's money well spent given the impact you all have had over the past six years, I think he said.

415
00:38:10,658 --> 00:38:13,260
Speaker 1: So you've got resilient coders going.

416
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,280
Speaker 1: You're teaching there.

417
00:38:15,401 --> 00:38:17,842
Speaker 1: And it sounds like you're having a big impact.

418
00:38:17,882 --> 00:38:24,305
Speaker 1: But was there a moment where you're like, I can have an even bigger impact by leveraging the power of the internet?

419
00:38:24,325 --> 00:38:29,767
Speaker 1: Like, what was the process that, and maybe I can back up a second to just say, what is 100 devs?

420
00:38:31,164 --> 00:38:32,845
Speaker 0: Yeah, sure.

421
00:38:33,045 --> 00:38:44,429
Speaker 0: So 100 devs is a collection of engineers that help build a completely free live software engineering training program for anyone anywhere.

422
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:46,991
Speaker 0: That was kind of our Genesis.

423
00:38:47,251 --> 00:38:57,395
Speaker 0: Now we're also building and we're going to be piloting this year a full service digital agency where real clients come to us to build products.

424
00:38:58,335 --> 00:39:03,880
Speaker 0: and get to tap into our amazing alumni that have gone on to work at some of the best tech companies in the world.

425
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,384
Speaker 0: we're talking Amazon, LinkedIn, Slack, you name it, we have an alumni there.

426
00:39:08,404 --> 00:39:10,546
Speaker 0: They come back to work on these projects.

427
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:13,789
Speaker 0: Each project is getting broken down into the individual tasks.

428
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:21,876
Speaker 0: And then as you're learning, you're also building real code for real companies and getting paid actual money to do it.

429
00:39:22,557 --> 00:39:38,882
Speaker 0: We mentioned early on that free isn't always free because it required you to have an extreme privilege of time to work through all this material to give up your nights and weekends and we wanted to do something that helps soften the blow for folks that are going through our program.

430
00:39:39,562 --> 00:39:40,943
Speaker 0: Our program is entirely free.

431
00:39:41,864 --> 00:39:45,186
Speaker 0: Every resource I have ever given out is always free.

432
00:39:45,226 --> 00:39:46,086
Speaker 0: I don't work with anybody.

433
00:39:46,106 --> 00:39:50,369
Speaker 0: It doesn't have a free version or something that we can have access to.

434
00:39:50,829 --> 00:40:02,917
Speaker 0: But we did a poll not too long ago that said, hey, we realized a lot of you can't commit the time or the take the time away from putting food on the table.

435
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:03,897
Speaker 0: What would it take?

436
00:40:04,998 --> 00:40:05,939
Speaker 0: for you to be able to focus.

437
00:40:06,379 --> 00:40:07,540
Speaker 0: And it was $200 a week.

438
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,981
Speaker 0: It was the average.

439
00:40:09,561 --> 00:40:10,342
Speaker 0: We can make that happen.

440
00:40:10,362 --> 00:40:16,987
Speaker 0: We can figure out a way to get folks those funds that they can focus and get through a program like a hundred doves.

441
00:40:17,067 --> 00:40:22,150
Speaker 0: And yeah, so now we're at the opportunity of discord is 60,000 plus strong.

442
00:40:22,791 --> 00:40:24,612
Speaker 0: We have alumni all around the world.

443
00:40:24,752 --> 00:40:37,080
Speaker 0: And we're just trying to figure out a way for folks to be able to unlock a stable high-growth career put food on the table, support themselves, and their family, and their loved ones.

444
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:42,582
Speaker 0: Luckily we found a lot of folks that believe in that idea, and mission two, we felt a wonderful community around it.

445
00:40:42,802 --> 00:40:43,102
Speaker 1: Yeah.

446
00:40:43,902 --> 00:40:47,443
Speaker 1: And so the mechanics of the community, like.

447
00:40:47,463 --> 00:40:53,026
Speaker 1: first of all, it goes with that thing that I'm in awe of what you all are accomplishing with hunter devs.

448
00:40:53,186 --> 00:41:00,950
Speaker 1: I've had so many positive interactions with people who are both using like the free cocaine curriculum and in the hundred devs.

449
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:03,271
Speaker 1: I guess you call it like a cohort or an intake group.

450
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:03,452
Speaker 1: Yeah.

451
00:41:03,772 --> 00:41:10,176
Speaker 1: Like basically a bunch of people working together through a set kind of like week to week program.

452
00:41:10,276 --> 00:41:16,559
Speaker 1: And I, you know, for your co camp, we have experimented with like cohorted programs and like, let's see if we can get all these people.

453
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,541
Speaker 1: But what we found is like, it's, it's a lot of work to organize.

454
00:41:20,962 --> 00:41:26,807
Speaker 1: very aware of and like frecocians philosophy is like let's just build the resources at scale put them out there.

455
00:41:27,988 --> 00:41:42,621
Speaker 1: Yes, lots of kids who are the you know the son or daughter of like software engineers in Palo Alto are going to use frecocamp and they're going to use them or free and they you know probably could have paid a bunch of money to have computer science student like tutor them or sling right.

456
00:41:43,161 --> 00:41:57,049
Speaker 1: but also a lot of kids who are in like a village in rural India or in like kind of like a failed state which a lot of people have smartphones and can get on the internet even in places like Somalia.

457
00:41:57,109 --> 00:42:05,334
Speaker 1: right North Korea right people in North Korea use free code camp sometimes and essentially they can.

458
00:42:05,514 --> 00:42:18,220
Speaker 1: they can learn Even though it would be normally prohibitively expensive for them to buy a 20 dollar course on a course website, for example.

459
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:27,844
Speaker 1: Our philosophy is we need to make sure that there is a baseline that everybody has access to comprehensive math programming computer science and English education.

460
00:42:28,884 --> 00:42:36,953
Speaker 1: So that everybody, regardless of their circumstances, if they have time, which not everybody does, but if they have time, or they can figure out techniques to make

461
00:42:36,993 --> 00:42:37,273
Speaker 0: time,

462
00:42:38,354 --> 00:42:45,622
Speaker 1: to learn even a little each day, then they can make steady forward progress toward the eventual goal of working as a software engineer.

463
00:42:46,078 --> 00:42:47,818
Speaker 1: right so so that is kind of like.

464
00:42:47,959 --> 00:43:04,343
Speaker 1: our philosophy is like let's just make tons of really high quality free stuff that's essentially subsidized by the community like the people who are able to give the alumni sometime like we got a gift for $250,000 the other day from companies.

465
00:43:04,383 --> 00:43:10,565
Speaker 1: Yeah, the CEO of Comtea is a fan of free co-camp and uses free co-camp to expand his JavaScript knowledge.

466
00:43:10,685 --> 00:43:11,325
Speaker 1: super chill dude.

467
00:43:11,945 --> 00:43:17,327
Speaker 1: You know we Darrell Silver founder of Thinkful kicked in $150,000.

468
00:43:17,327 --> 00:43:25,130
Speaker 1: And then, of course, we're getting grants from like, you know, Linux foundation and MongoDB and Google and a lot of other organizations.

469
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:29,552
Speaker 1: But a vast majority of our support comes directly from the community from people who donate.

470
00:43:29,592 --> 00:43:31,432
Speaker 1: So free code gives it already slash donate.

471
00:43:31,812 --> 00:43:32,053
Speaker 0: All right.

472
00:43:32,493 --> 00:43:33,533
Speaker 0: But my point is, yeah.

473
00:43:34,954 --> 00:43:36,754
Speaker 1: And thank you for supporting our charity.

474
00:43:37,135 --> 00:43:38,775
Speaker 1: I didn't even realize I apologize.

475
00:43:39,856 --> 00:43:44,157
Speaker 1: But maybe you're getting my periodic donor email, like I said, donor email.

476
00:43:44,338 --> 00:43:44,478
Speaker 1: Yeah.

477
00:43:47,102 --> 00:43:58,849
Speaker 1: my point in all all this little tangent is to say that like free co camp like we don't have the bandwidth to do things that don't scale and you are doing things that don't scale at all really like.

478
00:43:58,909 --> 00:44:14,858
Speaker 1: maybe you figured out some techniques to get like cohort to scale and get like because I mean you mentioned your discord has 60 thousand people in it but like actually getting on stream and like teaching for like a marathon on three five hours like how long you go.

479
00:44:14,878 --> 00:44:16,978
Speaker 1: it's really inspiring.

480
00:44:17,139 --> 00:44:19,580
Speaker 1: definitely catch some of the livestreams you can or I've watched.

481
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:35,771
Speaker 1: I watch everything at double speed so I watched like the video on demand but like I guess you saw it from coming from the like intensive program where you're teaching folks like you saw the merit of quality not just quantity or like.

482
00:44:36,211 --> 00:44:37,352
Speaker 1: I guess like content like.

483
00:44:37,713 --> 00:44:46,897
Speaker 1: I'm not like doing things that don't scale really And helping in people individually, it doesn't really scale, but that's not necessarily the idea.

484
00:44:46,957 --> 00:44:55,720
Speaker 1: The idea is to give a whole lot of attention to a smaller number of people and to really make sure that those people can ramp up to an impressive.

485
00:44:56,220 --> 00:45:02,982
Speaker 1: He said, like, what was the figure you said was like the median income of people who graduated?

486
00:45:02,982 --> 00:45:04,342
Speaker 0: 90,000 per person.

487
00:45:06,883 --> 00:45:09,584
Speaker 1: That's a lot more than I made in my first developer job, a given.

488
00:45:10,024 --> 00:45:16,327
Speaker 1: if this is embossed in like the cost living might be higher, but I mean, that's a lot of freaking money for people that like.

489
00:45:16,347 --> 00:45:19,848
Speaker 1: I imagine some of these people don't have university degrees.

490
00:45:19,928 --> 00:45:27,291
Speaker 1: I didn't even know that you hadn't completed your degree, although dropping out of Yale is probably very different from dropping out of like, you know, that's all right.

491
00:45:27,311 --> 00:45:28,152
Speaker 1: University, right?

492
00:45:29,452 --> 00:45:32,413
Speaker 1: Yeah, but sorry I've been talking for the last three minutes.

493
00:45:32,493 --> 00:45:49,562
Speaker 1: I'm just very excited about how you approach this and I want to make sure our audience appreciates the I guess counterintuitiveness of what you've done and how you've been able to like people weren't doing this because it was perhaps counterintuitive to do so.

494
00:45:49,622 --> 00:45:50,903
Speaker 1: It was like, for all of you, very dumb.

495
00:45:50,923 --> 00:45:51,984
Speaker 0: That idea, don't you?

496
00:45:52,004 --> 00:45:54,546
Speaker 0: Yeah.

497
00:45:54,586 --> 00:45:56,247
Speaker 1: So maybe you can talk about that.

498
00:45:56,307 --> 00:45:58,669
Speaker 1: Like, how do you have to do stuff that doesn't scale?

499
00:45:58,729 --> 00:46:00,070
Speaker 1: And like, ways that it doesn't scale.

500
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:02,872
Speaker 1: And then ways, like, techniques you figured out to scale in a little bit.

501
00:46:03,593 --> 00:46:04,493
Speaker 0: Sure, yeah, happy to.

502
00:46:04,934 --> 00:46:07,716
Speaker 0: I think the first thing that was just like shout out for your code camp.

503
00:46:07,756 --> 00:46:11,679
Speaker 0: Like, you all laid the foundation for so many folks to learn.

504
00:46:11,739 --> 00:46:26,200
Speaker 0: And one of the things I am always, I've been, especially, and I think that was on our discord as I think a lot of folks that go into this space don't put in the work to do the things that really matter the most.

505
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:31,044
Speaker 0: And so one of the things I've always admired about free code camp is this commitment to filling the gaps.

506
00:46:31,184 --> 00:46:35,688
Speaker 0: And so realizing that most people don't have the privilege of speaking English.

507
00:46:35,708 --> 00:46:38,290
Speaker 0: So we're going to build a full, like how do you speak English?

508
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:40,072
Speaker 0: course, right?

509
00:46:40,112 --> 00:46:40,552
Speaker 0: That's huge.

510
00:46:40,612 --> 00:46:52,651
Speaker 0: It's like very progressively thinking about what do our folks going through our program absolutely need and so that's why I'm so happy that Free Code Camp exists.

511
00:46:52,712 --> 00:47:08,467
Speaker 0: It's why it's one of the first things I always recommend to new folks getting into tech and why I think you all continue to be so successful because it's just like this relentless pursuit of making tech more equitable to everyone and so That's why I said really early on in this conversation.

512
00:47:08,507 --> 00:47:16,136
Speaker 0: I look up to you so much and it's a lot of that ethos that I've tried to bring to a hundred devs for 400 devs.

513
00:47:16,497 --> 00:47:20,301
Speaker 0: we got started during the pandemic and the pandemic hit.

514
00:47:21,511 --> 00:47:23,473
Speaker 0: things got really bad really quickly.

515
00:47:23,814 --> 00:47:28,419
Speaker 0: so people always like to talk and boss and about like a 2% unemployment rate.

516
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:35,567
Speaker 0: but I knew just from looking at the actual data we looked in our communities of color is already at 12%.

517
00:47:35,567 --> 00:47:36,808
Speaker 0: this is pre-pandemic.

518
00:47:37,429 --> 00:47:42,013
Speaker 0: He looked during the pandemic, it jumped from 12 to like 33% in some communities.

519
00:47:42,653 --> 00:47:45,175
Speaker 0: And so it got real bad, real quick.

520
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:52,241
Speaker 0: And I just, if you are already in tech, or if you already come from a privileged background, I don't think people really understand what that means.

521
00:47:52,301 --> 00:48:00,808
Speaker 0: when right now, like if you look at the most recent like labor data, like the median income, median, median is 56,000 in the US.

522
00:48:01,429 --> 00:48:14,915
Speaker 0: And so if we have that percent of folks under it and we're seeing 33% unemployment and then labor data actually includes like eligible workers it just got real bad real quick and it continues to be a really rough situation from folks.

523
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:17,216
Speaker 0: and so I'm not a doctor.

524
00:48:17,896 --> 00:48:30,402
Speaker 0: I didn't have like a skill that I thought that could be helpful to folks that were being affected by the pandemic but I had been teaching for a while and I knew that I could get folks skills to make them more employable.

525
00:48:30,622 --> 00:48:36,386
Speaker 0: and so a hundred dev started as a way of getting a hundred folks into software engineering.

526
00:48:36,467 --> 00:48:50,559
Speaker 0: jobs were way beyond that now and I wanted to make a live cohort where we would meet twice a week on the internet and I really thought it would be like you said just a handful of folks maybe five ten people.

527
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,522
Speaker 0: we did a pilot that was really successful.

528
00:48:53,962 --> 00:48:57,465
Speaker 0: our first cohort was about three hundred people every single class.

529
00:48:58,527 --> 00:48:59,187
Speaker 0: That was successful.

530
00:48:59,207 --> 00:49:04,109
Speaker 0: with another cohort that was like 30,000 people every single live, every single class.

531
00:49:04,489 --> 00:49:11,552
Speaker 0: And so we kind of just built slowly where we were able to kind of jump from zero to 300, 300, 300,000.

532
00:49:11,552 --> 00:49:14,093
Speaker 0: And we always joke that we're baddies.

533
00:49:14,333 --> 00:49:16,014
Speaker 0: We're baddies writing bad code.

534
00:49:16,034 --> 00:49:16,834
Speaker 0: Like it doesn't matter.

535
00:49:17,575 --> 00:49:19,435
Speaker 0: It's about getting the skills that we need.

536
00:49:19,475 --> 00:49:21,576
Speaker 0: It's about figuring out things on the fly.

537
00:49:21,596 --> 00:49:25,718
Speaker 0: And we just live up to being kind always to ourselves to others.

538
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:27,979
Speaker 0: And as long as you're willing to say, you know what?

539
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:29,560
Speaker 0: We got to figure this out.

540
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,481
Speaker 0: We got to figure out how do we do this at scale?

541
00:49:31,561 --> 00:49:36,365
Speaker 0: How do we have 3,000 people live in a class getting help and not feeling lost?

542
00:49:37,146 --> 00:49:44,031
Speaker 0: We had to figure systems and ways of doing that and building community that wanted to support that number of folks.

543
00:49:44,964 --> 00:49:45,244
Speaker 1: Awesome.

544
00:49:45,365 --> 00:49:50,891
Speaker 1: Well, what you said there first, like I just want to call it that, that particular insight, we're baddies, writing back, it doesn't matter.

545
00:49:51,371 --> 00:50:07,086
Speaker 1: So when I was a teenager, like really interested in writing and reading lots of fiction and literary journalism and stuff like that, I would always hang out at Denny's like till 2 a.m.

546
00:50:07,126 --> 00:50:16,251
Speaker 1: just talking to random people and learning from them and just writing and stuff and one time like our server he he was kind of a drizzle looking dude like he would.

547
00:50:16,331 --> 00:50:23,815
Speaker 1: he would not look at a place in like a bullpen in a newspaper newsroom if such thing exists in 2024.

548
00:50:23,815 --> 00:50:27,459
Speaker 1: But he's advice me, I'll never forget what he said.

549
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:32,064
Speaker 1: He said, throw away your first million words.

550
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,268
Speaker 0: And I love that.

551
00:50:35,528 --> 00:50:36,870
Speaker 1: Damn, a million words.

552
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:38,111
Speaker 1: That's like years of writing.

553
00:50:39,072 --> 00:50:41,794
Speaker 1: but just accept that it's gonna suck.

554
00:50:42,275 --> 00:50:44,136
Speaker 1: and the same thing with your code projects.

555
00:50:44,456 --> 00:50:47,118
Speaker 1: and really the same with any endeavor you take.

556
00:50:47,158 --> 00:50:47,319
Speaker 1: like.

557
00:50:47,819 --> 00:50:55,064
Speaker 1: I've been trying to get better at base for the past three or four years and like takes me forever to record the base intros for like.

558
00:50:55,565 --> 00:50:57,927
Speaker 0: I thought you like the one of the videos I watched.

559
00:50:57,967 --> 00:50:59,328
Speaker 0: you did it and then sat down.

560
00:50:59,348 --> 00:50:59,968
Speaker 0: so that's what I was.

561
00:51:00,008 --> 00:51:02,510
Speaker 0: I'm telling you that's what I was expecting for for today.

562
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:06,954
Speaker 0: so yeah that I'd think of the base intro live just for me.

563
00:51:07,034 --> 00:51:11,036
Speaker 1: but I didn't want to bother you with, like, watching me screw it up with several times.

564
00:51:11,697 --> 00:51:12,697
Speaker 0: Yeah, I love it.

565
00:51:13,138 --> 00:51:22,864
Speaker 1: But yeah, like, you just have to accept that the first few thousand hours you spend with an instrument or with like a programming language or with anything is going to be not ready for prime time.

566
00:51:23,644 --> 00:51:26,406
Speaker 1: You know, my wife, she grew up in China.

567
00:51:26,426 --> 00:51:28,807
Speaker 1: We met in grad school and she's now a U.S.

568
00:51:28,847 --> 00:51:29,248
Speaker 1: citizen.

569
00:51:29,288 --> 00:51:32,270
Speaker 1: We brought her over in naturalized or after grad school.

570
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:33,991
Speaker 1: If we got married, we've been married 19 years.

571
00:51:37,733 --> 00:51:39,253
Speaker 1: She loved, like, piano, right?

572
00:51:39,393 --> 00:51:43,735
Speaker 1: And one of the things that she says in China, like, people take piano extremely seriously.

573
00:51:44,275 --> 00:51:53,458
Speaker 1: And they have this saying in Chinese, which is basically, like, these spent thousands of hours behind the stage practicing for, you know, five minutes on the stage.

574
00:51:53,858 --> 00:51:56,479
Speaker 1: You know, like, that's just the nature of the game.

575
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:14,748
Speaker 1: And with code, like, if you're writing some serious system that's gonna, like, code that can be run millions of times, right like if you're making an open source contribution to free code camps code base and it's in the platform itself and this component is going to be rendered 50,000 times a day or something like that.

576
00:52:14,808 --> 00:52:16,109
Speaker 1: like.

577
00:52:16,409 --> 00:52:33,640
Speaker 1: it's okay that it took you a whole lot of work to get that like code into the shape and it's okay that it took a lot of practice and trial and error before you got the skills to be able to create that code that code just going to keep going right like when Elvis goes up on the stage and he's being filmed and he's playing.

578
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:39,564
Speaker 1: I use Elvis because I love Elvis.

579
00:52:39,604 --> 00:52:44,989
Speaker 1: He's the man so I mean like that guy practice like crazy.

580
00:52:45,369 --> 00:52:51,034
Speaker 1: that's definitely the same with for example like James Jamerson the greatest basis of all time.

581
00:52:51,254 --> 00:52:57,360
Speaker 1: basically or You know, like pretty much any musician, they're going to practice like crazy.

582
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:00,783
Speaker 1: They're going to rehearse obsessively, and they're not going to be satisfied.

583
00:53:00,983 --> 00:53:03,766
Speaker 1: But once that recording is made, once that record is cut.

584
00:53:04,287 --> 00:53:11,274
Speaker 1: If you, uh, there's a great, um, documentary about Lonious Monk, uh, the Jazz pianist, right?

585
00:53:11,434 --> 00:53:13,456
Speaker 1: And he would only do like two takes.

586
00:53:14,757 --> 00:53:16,599
Speaker 1: And he's just like after two takes.

587
00:53:16,699 --> 00:53:18,100
Speaker 1: whatever I do is going to be garbage.

588
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:25,686
Speaker 1: I'm done like use one of those takes, but how we got how he got so good that he could actually nail it in one or two takes.

589
00:53:26,047 --> 00:53:34,473
Speaker 1: was he practiced like a maniac and he spent so much time in the piano where a lot of you know I guess amateurs would.

590
00:53:34,493 --> 00:53:35,895
Speaker 1: it would just be like good enough.

591
00:53:36,275 --> 00:53:40,319
Speaker 1: he was not with that and so I feel the same way about.

592
00:53:40,359 --> 00:53:50,306
Speaker 1: like any undertaking, but like certainly with coding, it may seem like coding is not like a synchronous, performative event, like where you're having to sit down and perform in that regard.

593
00:53:50,346 --> 00:53:51,647
Speaker 1: You can go in, you can edit your code.

594
00:53:51,667 --> 00:53:52,448
Speaker 1: You can iterate on it.

595
00:53:52,508 --> 00:53:53,769
Speaker 1: The tools have gotten so much better.

596
00:53:54,249 --> 00:54:02,175
Speaker 1: Like free cooking up every millisecond or two, you're going to get the tests, like telling you whether you've met all the test conditions or what you need to keep tweaking your code, right?

597
00:54:02,555 --> 00:54:08,210
Speaker 1: So you have all these tools to iterate, but at the end of the day, like you should still try to approach it like a performance.

598
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:12,292
Speaker 1: You'll get a lot better if you don't rely so much on the tools catching what you're doing.

599
00:54:12,432 --> 00:54:18,254
Speaker 1: Anyway, I'm kind of going on a tangent, but I just wanted to riff on like the insight that it is.

600
00:54:18,294 --> 00:54:18,994
Speaker 1: We're all baddies.

601
00:54:19,695 --> 00:54:20,895
Speaker 1: We've been writing badgoat.

602
00:54:20,955 --> 00:54:23,556
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter because you throw away your first million words.

603
00:54:24,057 --> 00:54:29,419
Speaker 1: You spent thousands of hours at the piano before you're playing anything that's worth anybody listening to, right?

604
00:54:29,439 --> 00:54:32,120
Speaker 1: Like you just have to accept that this is the nature of reality.

605
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:33,241
Speaker 1: This is the nature of doing anything.

606
00:54:33,261 --> 00:54:36,509
Speaker 1: that's hard is it's going to be hard?

607
00:54:36,689 --> 00:54:42,174
Speaker 1: you're going to have to work hard and you have to just have that mental fortitude and that's something that comes through in your.

608
00:54:42,294 --> 00:54:48,760
Speaker 1: your video is like it's so supportive like I love the way that you're just like it's all good like just this happens to.

609
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:52,699
Speaker 1: everybody has to go through this you know, I always like to say like.

610
00:54:53,339 --> 00:55:00,024
Speaker 1: there's some people maybe like slightly better at programming like aptitude-wise or like they may have some intrinsic like cork.

611
00:55:00,064 --> 00:55:02,125
Speaker 1: that makes them marginally better at programming.

612
00:55:02,646 --> 00:55:09,330
Speaker 1: but those people were probably just forgotten how much time they spent at the keyboard when they were kid if they were publishing enough to grow up with computers.

613
00:55:09,771 --> 00:55:18,377
Speaker 1: right like you know when you hear like Bill Gates talk about how like oh I don't actually like write out the code until I figured everything out in my head and then I said that's nonsense.

614
00:55:19,403 --> 00:55:24,968
Speaker 1: Bill Gates did not just sit down and like right basic from memory because he'd like been moving everything around his head.

615
00:55:25,068 --> 00:55:25,768
Speaker 1: people can't do that.

616
00:55:25,828 --> 00:55:26,449
Speaker 1: I don't believe that.

617
00:55:26,509 --> 00:55:33,155
Speaker 1: maybe there are some people that have like some extreme form of like like extreme brains that you do something like that.

618
00:55:33,195 --> 00:55:35,236
Speaker 1: but I don't believe that Bill Gates could do that sort of stuff.

619
00:55:35,296 --> 00:55:47,646
Speaker 1: I think he's just talking up the mythos You know, he's trying to build up hype for himself and like it's this old kind of like old school elitism that a lot of the early devs the old guard have and just don't buy.

620
00:55:47,666 --> 00:55:53,611
Speaker 1: that hype is all I want to say and I want to thank you for like dispelling a lot of that whether you're intentionally dispelling or not.

621
00:55:53,691 --> 00:56:03,889
Speaker 0: just telling people like coding is hard right like not not sugar coding it we call it the trough the sorrow which actually comes from like startup worlds one of the things.

622
00:56:03,909 --> 00:56:29,422
Speaker 0: there's this very classic graph of like um this like really big hill that you go up when you're really excited about something like yeah I'm going to wear the coat on you buy a thousand demi courses because buying stuff feels good even though you're not going to do them and get the very top and then you start like day one of any actual coding program and then you just plumb it once you realize how long it's going to take and then you spend all that time going through the trough of sorrow.

623
00:56:29,802 --> 00:56:38,024
Speaker 0: and then the most like sick thing about this is that the most twisted thing about this is at the very end there's even further dip.

624
00:56:38,044 --> 00:56:42,825
Speaker 0: they have to go through where you it's the and then you get into what they call the wiggles of false hope.

625
00:56:42,845 --> 00:56:45,366
Speaker 0: so even after you've gone through you've learned everything needed to learn.

626
00:56:45,766 --> 00:56:49,588
Speaker 0: You start actually interviewing you and you get the job and you just get rejected, rejected, rejected.

627
00:56:49,648 --> 00:56:57,111
Speaker 0: And so there's just this huge curve, long-trough of sorrow that for a lot of folks takes years to get through.

628
00:56:57,131 --> 00:57:03,954
Speaker 0: Then once you get to the end where you're like trying to actually get something out of it, it gets even worse and then slowly, slowly gets better.

629
00:57:04,054 --> 00:57:11,157
Speaker 0: So the thing that big thing for what we do like you mentioned at a hundred devs is just helping folks manage that frustration.

630
00:57:11,937 --> 00:57:18,342
Speaker 0: We have like three key things that we just say every class almost, imagine frustration, be consistent and take care of yourself.

631
00:57:18,882 --> 00:57:30,050
Speaker 0: When you look at how adults learn, the reason why adults kind of probably don't learn as well as they think they could is because they don't manage that frustration piece.

632
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:33,933
Speaker 0: When they look that, language fluency in like language acquisition.

633
00:57:34,253 --> 00:57:40,334
Speaker 0: They thought that we probably lost the ability to be fluent in our teenage years, but they found that that probably isn't true.

634
00:57:40,375 --> 00:57:43,835
Speaker 0: It's just once you get out of those years, your time is entirely your own.

635
00:57:43,895 --> 00:57:49,876
Speaker 0: And so what you rather do is think that sucks for two years or would you actually sit down and do it.

636
00:57:49,896 --> 00:57:54,737
Speaker 0: And so it folks that can manage that frustration to actually be get through the things they want to do.

637
00:57:55,177 --> 00:57:56,317
Speaker 0: And so that's a big part.

638
00:57:56,557 --> 00:57:57,977
Speaker 0: And it's also why we're live.

639
00:57:58,958 --> 00:58:02,691
Speaker 0: When you look at of their programs.

640
00:58:02,831 --> 00:58:04,292
Speaker 0: I love Dr.

641
00:58:04,312 --> 00:58:05,372
Speaker 0: Malen out of Harvard.

642
00:58:05,652 --> 00:58:06,713
Speaker 0: Yeah, 50.

643
00:58:06,713 --> 00:58:09,834
Speaker 0: Usually the CS50 is now on free cooking.

644
00:58:10,094 --> 00:58:27,212
Speaker 0: Every single article they've ever put out and one of the ones that are really interesting is they actually published all of their data for CS50 in the beginning, which is really cool to read through and you notice that They had like 150,000 people that signed up for like the first one of the course.

645
00:58:27,812 --> 00:58:34,014
Speaker 0: They said like 100,000 people that engaged, but only like 1% completed it, right?

646
00:58:34,534 --> 00:58:45,457
Speaker 0: And so that was something that really kind of stuck in my brain because when you look at that, you like in-person program, like the live in-person program, it was like 99% completion.

647
00:58:47,037 --> 00:59:02,598
Speaker 0: So there's something there and I think the being lied, being with the cohort of other individuals, being with real people, being with community, can help you ease that frustration, get help when you need it and be a little bit more consistent and actually get to the end.

648
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:04,687
Speaker 1: Yeah, absolutely.

649
00:59:04,727 --> 00:59:10,590
Speaker 1: Like there's positive peer pressure, essentially you have like having your peers going through it with you.

650
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:14,392
Speaker 1: Like that's the beauty of cohort of models that is difficult to reproduce.

651
00:59:14,432 --> 00:59:20,095
Speaker 1: But if you can reproduce it, like Leon Noel has, then man, you've got like lighting in a bottle.

652
00:59:20,135 --> 00:59:27,880
Speaker 1: like you've got people who are going to have each other's backs and like when you're down they're up and they'll help you get back up right.

653
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,100
Speaker 1: so you help each other.

654
00:59:29,781 --> 00:59:32,622
Speaker 1: so that's kind of the genes of 100 devs.

655
00:59:32,762 --> 00:59:34,483
Speaker 1: maybe you can talk a little bit about the mechanics of it.

656
00:59:34,523 --> 00:59:35,524
Speaker 1: obviously you've got the discord.

657
00:59:35,564 --> 00:59:44,428
Speaker 1: you've got the twice weekly streams when classes in session so to speak and they are high energy streams.

658
00:59:44,448 --> 00:59:45,569
Speaker 1: man, I just had to comment.

659
00:59:45,609 --> 00:59:50,190
Speaker 1: like you go like the boom boom boom, like you're like the cool astronaut back around.

660
00:59:50,571 --> 01:00:15,587
Speaker 1: It's like watching like a gamer on twitch like like watching somebody play and like you know CSGO at a high level or something a little bit of education right like into in my mind like you're pioneering kind of a new approach to education that is based off of like people already familiar with like games and anime and all the other cultural kind of touchstones and you're just like hey let's let's relate this to software engineering.

661
01:00:15,767 --> 01:00:18,390
Speaker 1: right and is so you're doing a great job of that.

662
01:00:18,430 --> 01:00:23,276
Speaker 1: but if you can talk about an addition to the stream in addition to the discord what are the other aspects of 100 devs?

663
01:00:23,296 --> 01:00:25,358
Speaker 1: what are the other instruments?

664
01:00:26,115 --> 01:00:29,717
Speaker 0: Sure, so we do a live cohort model.

665
01:00:29,737 --> 01:00:31,357
Speaker 0: We basically do a cohort a year.

666
01:00:32,338 --> 01:00:39,661
Speaker 0: And when that cohort is live, we're live on Twitch twice a week for about three hours for a class.

667
01:00:40,241 --> 01:00:45,524
Speaker 0: We take about an hour to do review, space repetition, active recall is super important.

668
01:00:46,404 --> 01:00:50,086
Speaker 0: So we start that first hour just like reviewing and then about two hours is something new.

669
01:00:50,106 --> 01:00:50,926
Speaker 0: We do that twice a week.

670
01:00:51,326 --> 01:01:01,391
Speaker 0: and then we have office hours on Sunday, which is another stream typically on Twitch or on Discord but it's just people asking questions and getting things answered.

671
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:06,994
Speaker 0: Outside of that, there are so many other expectations and things that you're working on.

672
01:01:07,034 --> 01:01:10,717
Speaker 0: that's about 10 to 20 hours outside of that twice a week class.

673
01:01:11,197 --> 01:01:14,260
Speaker 0: Networking, all the things that are going to actually move the needle for you to get a job.

674
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:22,767
Speaker 0: Our joke is that we're not really a coding program, we're a getting a job program and so all the things that you can be doing to get a job have to be happening when we're not live.

675
01:01:23,467 --> 01:01:33,989
Speaker 0: Then for folks that can't participate in a live experience, we have our lustrous ketchup crew, which is a group of folks that are working through the classes at maybe a little bit more of their own pace.

676
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:38,351
Speaker 0: We have a lot of folks that are around the world that can't make that live time work for them.

677
01:01:38,731 --> 01:01:42,151
Speaker 0: So they get together, they're on our discord, working through the classes together.

678
01:01:42,411 --> 01:01:47,053
Speaker 0: You'll often see like 20 people just in a voice channel watching a class together.

679
01:01:47,073 --> 01:01:50,354
Speaker 0: They've just, they've come together to do.

680
01:01:51,014 --> 01:01:52,936
Speaker 0: So you can move through the material at your own pace.

681
01:01:53,616 --> 01:01:59,000
Speaker 0: When we're outside of the cohort right now, we have our huddles twice a week.

682
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:03,083
Speaker 0: And the huddles are just like a traditional stand-up, we're just trying to move away from the back.

683
01:02:03,403 --> 01:02:06,665
Speaker 0: I think it's a slightly ableist term, so we're, we introduce them as huddles.

684
01:02:07,346 --> 01:02:08,226
Speaker 1: And yeah, that makes sense.

685
01:02:08,246 --> 01:02:10,128
Speaker 1: I never thought about stand-up as an ableist term.

686
01:02:10,468 --> 01:02:12,169
Speaker 1: But yeah, a lot of people can't stand up.

687
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:35,197
Speaker 0: And so we We'll have anywhere from like 500 to 700 people every huddle, just asking questions, sharing, we call the job hunt, the hunt, sharing what's happening on the hunt, how they are negotiating, they'll come up live, we'll help them negotiate offers, they'll talk about an interview that went great or poorly.

688
01:02:35,597 --> 01:02:45,994
Speaker 0: and just by showing up to these huddles, you're learning all these, it's so hard to go through life, with everything that you're experiencing, being the first time you've experienced it.

689
01:02:46,295 --> 01:02:51,200
Speaker 0: It doesn't have to be that way, specifically with when you have a community that's also doing it.

690
01:02:51,300 --> 01:03:02,792
Speaker 0: So the huddles are our way to expose people to the realities of getting a job going and interviewing and actually seeing all this knowledge and so that when you're in that situation, you can experience it too.

691
01:03:04,053 --> 01:03:08,755
Speaker 0: We have the huddles twice a week, and then we have a lot of independently generated community things.

692
01:03:08,835 --> 01:03:17,778
Speaker 0: So we have Bankie Brunch, shot up Bankie Brunch, which is a group of folks that come together to work through behavioral questions, technical questions, pretty much every single day.

693
01:03:18,418 --> 01:03:21,639
Speaker 0: We have groups that are working on projects of which channels are always going.

694
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:27,765
Speaker 0: None of this works without community and a wonderful group of mods.

695
01:03:28,225 --> 01:03:41,779
Speaker 0: I'd be remiss to not say, Miriam, Devaker, Mayan Wolfe, Claire, these folks that like blow that make like all this work and for free and volunteering so much of their life to like make this happen.

696
01:03:42,717 --> 01:03:43,097
Speaker 1: amazing.

697
01:03:43,558 --> 01:03:50,785
Speaker 1: Yeah, like free cocaine, similarly, to drop our lives through our organization, very community driven like.

698
01:03:51,225 --> 01:03:53,648
Speaker 1: we have tons of mods on the forum on discord.

699
01:03:54,148 --> 01:04:23,976
Speaker 1: We open source contributors that are just dropping in and fixing little bugs making sure that our copy is readable as possible to monitor being the speakers making sure that like It's a lot of contributor driven activity and it sounds like you've figured out a way to encourage a lot of people in your community and power them with, you know, you can delegate some degree of, I guess, authority to them so that they can go out and they can just experiment and build out different things.

700
01:04:25,097 --> 01:04:29,480
Speaker 1: One of the things that you said that I thought was really interesting, I do want to talk about it.

701
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:33,582
Speaker 1: Let's talk about space repetition and active recall, I believe, of the terms.

702
01:04:34,523 --> 01:04:37,165
Speaker 1: Barbara Oakley teaches the learn course.

703
01:04:37,605 --> 01:04:45,870
Speaker 1: The most popular MOOC massive open online course ever other than maybe like CS50, which we were talking about earlier, learning how to learn.

704
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:49,112
Speaker 1: It's not just obvious how to learn where tactics are.

705
01:04:49,312 --> 01:04:59,782
Speaker 1: Right, there are phenomena that are ingrained in the human brain from, you know, evolution from like the, you know, Savannah's of Africa basically.

706
01:05:00,043 --> 01:05:00,443
Speaker 1: Yeah.

707
01:05:00,623 --> 01:05:05,588
Speaker 1: That we carry with us today that we can use if we know how to use them.

708
01:05:05,628 --> 01:05:07,710
Speaker 1: And one of them you mentioned is space repetition.

709
01:05:08,111 --> 01:05:09,152
Speaker 1: What is space repetition?

710
01:05:09,892 --> 01:05:17,077
Speaker 0: Yeah sure so I guess kind of to set the stage real quick is that a lot of folks that attempt to learn how to code are not successful.

711
01:05:17,597 --> 01:05:19,018
Speaker 0: We know that we know the drop-offs.

712
01:05:19,058 --> 01:05:20,759
Speaker 0: We know that that's just the reality.

713
01:05:21,399 --> 01:05:25,562
Speaker 0: and a lot of times those people feel like that it is them that it's a they.

714
01:05:26,102 --> 01:05:28,503
Speaker 0: they do not have the ability to learn how to code they do not have.

715
01:05:28,523 --> 01:05:32,466
Speaker 0: there's something about them that would stop them from being successful as a software engineer.

716
01:05:33,166 --> 01:05:45,599
Speaker 0: And if someone that's worked with thousands of people, like literally in the classroom, my finger is on their keyboard, I just know fundamentally my heart of hearts, like outside of a cognitive impairment.

717
01:05:45,639 --> 01:05:46,900
Speaker 0: that's just not true.

718
01:05:47,421 --> 01:05:53,847
Speaker 0: And the thing that I found is it's just that most people don't know how to learn.

719
01:05:54,908 --> 01:06:07,512
Speaker 0: And it's almost criminal that our school system doesn't actually teach us how to learn that every textbook doesn't have some very fundamental things at the beginning that help you remember and learn this material.

720
01:06:07,972 --> 01:06:11,693
Speaker 0: So the difficult thing about software engineering is that it's a cumulative career.

721
01:06:11,753 --> 01:06:15,254
Speaker 0: The things you learn this week, you might need two years from now.

722
01:06:15,874 --> 01:06:21,706
Speaker 0: And so there are two really fundamental Learning techniques that Dr.

723
01:06:21,726 --> 01:06:22,908
Speaker 0: Barbara Oakley does walk through.

724
01:06:22,928 --> 01:06:23,268
Speaker 0: that I really.

725
01:06:23,308 --> 01:06:25,090
Speaker 0: it's my favorite one of my favorite courses of all time.

726
01:06:25,651 --> 01:06:32,655
Speaker 0: that brings up where as humans we forget stuff very quickly.

727
01:06:33,436 --> 01:06:41,702
Speaker 0: So, if I gave you a three letter code, this is called the M&H curve, it was a study of one, it's somewhat been replicated since then.

728
01:06:42,042 --> 01:06:47,046
Speaker 0: But basically, this person just tracked a new three letter word, a three letter code every day.

729
01:06:47,566 --> 01:06:52,490
Speaker 0: And they found within the first like 30 minutes, there was a 20% chance they'd just forgotten it.

730
01:06:53,069 --> 01:06:57,631
Speaker 0: The first 30 minutes, so imagine trying to learn is really complicated coding stuff.

731
01:06:58,232 --> 01:06:59,993
Speaker 0: And within the first three minutes, you're going to forget it.

732
01:07:00,513 --> 01:07:07,156
Speaker 0: Then if you look at that forgetting curve by the end of the month, there's an 80% chance that you forgot in that very simple thing.

733
01:07:08,737 --> 01:07:12,299
Speaker 0: for a lot of folks that are going into coding education, they don't realize that they're forgetting.

734
01:07:12,339 --> 01:07:13,840
Speaker 0: curve is very steep.

735
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:17,442
Speaker 0: They learn something a month later, they've completely forgotten it.

736
01:07:17,482 --> 01:07:17,762
Speaker 0: Yeah.

737
01:07:17,822 --> 01:07:19,843
Speaker 0: Start back over and that's super frustrating.

738
01:07:20,344 --> 01:07:27,628
Speaker 0: So space repetition is using a tool that makes the material come back to you when you need it most.

739
01:07:28,228 --> 01:07:32,410
Speaker 0: And so a typical tool for this is Ankee or Ankee, how do you want to call it?

740
01:07:32,751 --> 01:07:33,611
Speaker 0: That's like Ankee.

741
01:07:33,691 --> 01:07:35,872
Speaker 1: It means to commit to memory in Japanese.

742
01:07:35,892 --> 01:07:35,992
Speaker 1: Yeah.

743
01:07:36,032 --> 01:07:36,493
Speaker 1: Ankee, so do.

744
01:07:37,253 --> 01:07:37,813
Speaker 0: Exactly.

745
01:07:38,213 --> 01:07:42,994
Speaker 0: And so it is a flash card tool that has an algorithm behind it.

746
01:07:43,314 --> 01:07:45,875
Speaker 0: So that surfaces the information when you need to see it.

747
01:07:45,935 --> 01:07:50,736
Speaker 0: So if you're doing good study habits, which is a huge portion of what we teach at 100 devs, it's just like how to study.

748
01:07:51,036 --> 01:07:57,397
Speaker 0: You're using this tool so that the things you learned about HTML, you're not forgetting when we're talking about like MongoDB.

749
01:07:57,617 --> 01:07:57,837
Speaker 0: Right?

750
01:07:57,897 --> 01:08:03,958
Speaker 0: And so that speech repetition is going to help you remember stuff for the long call, which is really important for a cumulative career.

751
01:08:04,558 --> 01:08:10,221
Speaker 0: But then the other thing that's even more important in my opinion than spatial rotation is something called active recall.

752
01:08:12,002 --> 01:08:21,987
Speaker 0: Coding can be done through like video tutorials can be done through text but it's a lot of information the process and most people just go through it.

753
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:25,040
Speaker 0: That's not active learning.

754
01:08:25,479 --> 01:08:34,982
Speaker 0: They feel maybe some sort of productivity from having watched tutorial or having read a blog post, but they didn't actually engage with that material or learn.

755
01:08:35,323 --> 01:08:42,743
Speaker 0: And a lot of times, like for me, I teleport through information, like I found reading a book, I'll get through three paragraphs and like what the heck just happened?

756
01:08:42,764 --> 01:08:45,145
Speaker 0: I feel like I've just teleported through that.

757
01:08:45,165 --> 01:08:55,327
Speaker 1: I even heard that expression, but that's a good way to describe the phenomenon, especially, you know, people who have like ADHD and stuff they may just be like, halfway through, you know, a book maybe.

758
01:08:56,768 --> 01:08:58,087
Speaker 1: You just, your mind wanders.

759
01:08:58,787 --> 01:09:03,950
Speaker 1: And if you're not constantly kind of trying to engage with it, you won't necessarily retain it.

760
01:09:04,130 --> 01:09:08,892
Speaker 0: Active recall is the way that that helps me as someone that does a VHD like do this.

761
01:09:08,971 --> 01:09:14,234
Speaker 0: And so, Active recall is just recalling the things that you just learned or just read or just watched.

762
01:09:14,854 --> 01:09:18,935
Speaker 0: And for folks that do have attention issues, I recommend doing that after each paragraph.

763
01:09:20,417 --> 01:09:22,318
Speaker 0: I recommend doing after each chapter end.

764
01:09:22,899 --> 01:09:26,020
Speaker 0: And you're just literally talking to yourself, what did I just read?

765
01:09:26,041 --> 01:09:27,002
Speaker 0: What did I just learn?

766
01:09:27,022 --> 01:09:28,263
Speaker 0: And you're saying it out loud.

767
01:09:28,743 --> 01:09:32,527
Speaker 0: The research behind it is really shocking, like staggering differences.

768
01:09:33,228 --> 01:09:39,733
Speaker 0: You can learn something once, actively recall it once and do better than somebody that re-read it four times.

769
01:09:41,107 --> 01:09:45,609
Speaker 0: Like you can do a quarter of the effort and have better results, just with this one technique.

770
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:50,372
Speaker 0: And the fact that that's not like stamped in every single textbook ever made is absurd.

771
01:09:50,732 --> 01:09:51,393
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's.

772
01:09:52,033 --> 01:09:59,477
Speaker 1: I mean, like we could talk all day about like the shortcomings of the US education system, like both both K through 12 and higher ed.

773
01:09:59,517 --> 01:10:01,038
Speaker 1: And that would be completely clear.

774
01:10:01,238 --> 01:10:05,761
Speaker 1: There are a lot of very smart people who are working very hard to address a lot of these deficiencies.

775
01:10:06,451 --> 01:10:15,636
Speaker 1: but the fact that we're having to explain what active recall and, you know, space for a petitioner, when they're, you know, like time-tested phenomenon that you can leverage.

776
01:10:16,137 --> 01:10:22,100
Speaker 1: So just a quick note about actually recall, this is one of the reasons why Free Code Camp's entire curriculum is interactive.

777
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,561
Speaker 1: It's because you have to grapple with things.

778
01:10:24,862 --> 01:10:27,743
Speaker 1: Otherwise, it's just, it could've just blown right past you, right?

779
01:10:27,863 --> 01:10:32,046
Speaker 1: Like, everything needs some sort of evaluation criteria, some sort of comprehension check.

780
01:10:32,706 --> 01:10:42,949
Speaker 1: And if you're doing something that doesn't have a comprehensive check, if there's not some right or wrong answer, take your moment to summarize what you just learned or relate it to something else you've learned, thinking about it, just grappling with it.

781
01:10:43,429 --> 01:10:48,371
Speaker 1: That can absolutely help submit those, you know, synapses, right?

782
01:10:48,391 --> 01:10:51,172
Speaker 1: Well, that's the thing that connects the synapses.

783
01:10:51,412 --> 01:10:53,712
Speaker 1: Actually, not the synapses.

784
01:10:53,732 --> 01:10:54,873
Speaker 1: I can't remember.

785
01:10:55,313 --> 01:11:05,170
Speaker 1: But yeah, like, And it's something anybody can do, like when I'm reading a news article or something like that, right?

786
01:11:05,190 --> 01:11:06,031
Speaker 1: That's not interactive.

787
01:11:06,071 --> 01:11:12,254
Speaker 1: Now, with GPT or something, I can throw it in GPT and say, hey, come up with like a multiple choice question based off the started, but I'll do that sometimes.

788
01:11:13,014 --> 01:11:17,216
Speaker 1: And not just for like actual recall, but space for repetition.

789
01:11:17,936 --> 01:11:25,460
Speaker 1: right a bunch of notes and then review them a few days later or use a tool like onkey that can systematically do that, we can load a bunch of flashcards.

790
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:29,182
Speaker 1: A lot of learning platforms have space for repetition just built into them.

791
01:11:29,222 --> 01:11:30,402
Speaker 1: If you go through the free code can't?

792
01:11:30,422 --> 01:11:37,806
Speaker 1: curriculum, it's designed in such a way that we're going to reintroduce concepts over and over and over and you're going to be like, oh yeah, I kind of remember this from like

793
01:11:38,286 --> 01:11:38,486
Speaker 0: a few

794
01:11:38,526 --> 01:11:45,073
Speaker 1: hours ago, you know, like, or a few days ago, like, but, but we're intentionally trying to, you know, incorporate that.

795
01:11:45,133 --> 01:11:53,001
Speaker 1: And one of the things I think talking about the free cocaine curriculum, let's talk about 100 devs and like what you all are, and is it 100 devs or 100 devs?

796
01:11:55,154 --> 01:11:55,795
Speaker 0: I could say either.

797
01:11:55,795 --> 01:11:57,397
Speaker 0: 100 devs.

798
01:11:57,397 --> 01:11:59,940
Speaker 1: 100 devs is shorter.

799
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:00,200
Speaker 1: Yeah.

800
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:02,823
Speaker 1: It sounds more like easy to say.

801
01:12:03,123 --> 01:12:07,548
Speaker 1: So with 100 devs, what is the coursework that you're going through?

802
01:12:07,688 --> 01:12:08,569
Speaker 1: Are you using MOOCs?

803
01:12:08,630 --> 01:12:10,211
Speaker 1: Are you using open textbooks?

804
01:12:10,251 --> 01:12:12,114
Speaker 1: Are you creating a lot of the stuff yourself?

805
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:12,834
Speaker 0: Yeah.

806
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:14,777
Speaker 0: I think there's like two important things.

807
01:12:16,158 --> 01:12:18,398
Speaker 0: I really don't believe the content matters.

808
01:12:19,039 --> 01:12:32,981
Speaker 0: It's all like where jobs program and I think the biggest mistakes people make is like an over-investment and the idea that the thing like that the learning aspect and not all the other things that move the needle.

809
01:12:33,041 --> 01:12:39,742
Speaker 0: So we're very much to kind of tracks like we have all this other stuff we're doing outside of the learning and then the learning as well.

810
01:12:39,802 --> 01:12:41,462
Speaker 0: So the learning is very simple.

811
01:12:42,062 --> 01:12:51,668
Speaker 0: We do full-stack JavaScript and And I do a lot of custom, like I make all the lectures basically with the slides and all the funny stuff that you mentioned on Twitch.

812
01:12:52,069 --> 01:12:54,090
Speaker 0: And we move through that material together.

813
01:12:54,571 --> 01:12:59,454
Speaker 0: But a lot of it is supplementing with other things that I think are just the best free courses out there.

814
01:12:59,575 --> 01:13:02,617
Speaker 0: So in the beginning, our students will use some free codecab.

815
01:13:03,197 --> 01:13:04,739
Speaker 0: as they get a little bit further along.

816
01:13:05,179 --> 01:13:12,365
Speaker 0: They'll use some things maybe from full stack open that are trying to supplement the things that we're doing in the classroom.

817
01:13:13,005 --> 01:13:15,966
Speaker 0: And any time that we're doing something, it's always a free resource.

818
01:13:16,226 --> 01:13:17,887
Speaker 0: It always is a free trial.

819
01:13:18,067 --> 01:13:19,248
Speaker 0: That's like a free app.

820
01:13:19,508 --> 01:13:20,388
Speaker 1: Love that.

821
01:13:20,708 --> 01:13:20,868
Speaker 0: Yeah.

822
01:13:20,908 --> 01:13:21,849
Speaker 0: Yeah.

823
01:13:21,969 --> 01:13:25,710
Speaker 0: And so we give you the skills to be a full stack web developer.

824
01:13:26,111 --> 01:13:31,033
Speaker 0: We do some of the other kind of rounding out to give you the software engineering skills set.

825
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:33,134
Speaker 0: The tooling and things that you might use.

826
01:13:33,174 --> 01:13:37,976
Speaker 0: And then as you're getting ready to go in the hunt, the data structures and algorithms, you're going to need to be successful.

827
01:13:38,576 --> 01:13:40,677
Speaker 0: But that's kind of like the coding stuff.

828
01:13:41,377 --> 01:13:46,159
Speaker 0: outside of that from the very beginning there's pretty stringent requirements in terms of like.

829
01:13:46,179 --> 01:13:54,182
Speaker 0: you're networking so you are posted beginning three connections and two coffee chats every single week throughout program.

830
01:13:54,602 --> 01:14:01,644
Speaker 0: you're doing things that are going to be opening all these doors to help you get a job and that's kind of another.

831
01:14:01,664 --> 01:14:11,087
Speaker 0: really I think that's where our curriculum shines is those things that are really helpful and impactful for helping you get a job actually have a lot of folks that do other boot camps which we love like.

832
01:14:11,827 --> 01:14:22,470
Speaker 0: I don't really care where you come from what you do as long as like you're getting to where you want to go and a lot of folks will join us just for like the how to get a job portion which I think we're pretty strong at awesome.

833
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:31,896
Speaker 1: So it's so interesting and important that you distinguish yourself as like a not learning coding program, but a get a job program.

834
01:14:32,756 --> 01:14:47,626
Speaker 1: And I just want to emphasize like even though we put a great deal of time and energy into our curriculum, it's absolutely like if you took a look at where all the donations we get and things like that go toward its instructional design platform development mainly for the core curriculum.

835
01:14:48,787 --> 01:14:56,495
Speaker 1: because for us it is important that there's a really good core curriculum, but I'll be the first to tell you or I guess the second since Leon just said it.

836
01:14:58,356 --> 01:15:02,079
Speaker 1: Getting a job as a developer is really three things in my humble opinion.

837
01:15:02,519 --> 01:15:09,504
Speaker 1: And if you haven't read my free book that I published about a year ago, learn to code and get a developer job.

838
01:15:09,664 --> 01:15:10,624
Speaker 1: I'm not really the name of the book.

839
01:15:10,864 --> 01:15:13,146
Speaker 1: Just Google that or Google code book.

840
01:15:13,246 --> 01:15:14,527
Speaker 1: And I learned to code book.

841
01:15:14,627 --> 01:15:16,648
Speaker 1: I think you should find it pretty quickly.

842
01:15:17,769 --> 01:15:20,671
Speaker 1: And by finding it and clicking on it, it's spending a lot of time on the page.

843
01:15:20,711 --> 01:15:23,233
Speaker 1: You help ensure that Google can do needs to recommend it to people.

844
01:15:26,684 --> 01:15:28,465
Speaker 1: skills are only one leg of the stool.

845
01:15:29,306 --> 01:15:32,108
Speaker 1: Network and reputation are the other two.

846
01:15:32,348 --> 01:15:35,631
Speaker 1: And we've talked enough about skills.

847
01:15:35,651 --> 01:15:42,857
Speaker 1: Let's jump into networking and building your reputation, which are two things that are also instrumental to the 100 devs program.

848
01:15:44,158 --> 01:15:44,378
Speaker 1: Yeah.

849
01:15:44,438 --> 01:15:48,020
Speaker 1: Like what is the value of a network?

850
01:15:48,121 --> 01:15:53,204
Speaker 1: Why is networking worth your time and energy when it's such an awkward thing to do?

851
01:15:54,666 --> 01:15:55,666
Speaker 0: Yeah, we have.

852
01:15:58,158 --> 01:16:03,539
Speaker 0: It's just like we have like a lot of like in jokes and things like that that if like you're not part of the community it's like weird to bring up.

853
01:16:03,599 --> 01:16:05,939
Speaker 0: but we refer to most people as clickers.

854
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:13,681
Speaker 0: People that learn how to code and then they just click apply and clickers don't get jobs.

855
01:16:13,881 --> 01:16:14,661
Speaker 0: Maybe everyone's.

856
01:16:14,681 --> 01:16:18,922
Speaker 0: in a while somebody gets lucky and they click on a button and they magic can get a job.

857
01:16:19,082 --> 01:16:26,303
Speaker 0: but especially in this market, clickers don't get jobs and so we do everything in our power to never click apply.

858
01:16:27,003 --> 01:16:42,015
Speaker 0: We want to make sure that we're talking to real humans that can see our humanity, that can see our ability and our skills and the things that we can do so that we're not just discarded by some AI, ATS system.

859
01:16:42,715 --> 01:16:47,919
Speaker 0: And so from the very beginning of 100 devs, we're asking you with generalized networking.

860
01:16:48,539 --> 01:16:53,683
Speaker 0: And networking, I think it's like a scary term that I don't think should be, to me networking is just making friends.

861
01:16:54,563 --> 01:16:59,707
Speaker 0: And you want to do things in the beginning that gets you comfortable with making friends.

862
01:17:00,187 --> 01:17:05,410
Speaker 0: And so you don't have to start networking by going to your local Python meetup, super hard core.

863
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:05,851
Speaker 0: Like, oh no.

864
01:17:06,491 --> 01:17:10,454
Speaker 0: If you like Pokemon, go play Pokemon on at your local league, right?

865
01:17:10,514 --> 01:17:19,540
Speaker 0: Or like, if you like hiking, going to join like a hiking group and just like share, passion with some others, get comfortable talking to people.

866
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:23,122
Speaker 0: And then eventually apply those skills that you learn to.

867
01:17:23,402 --> 01:17:30,066
Speaker 0: Places where developers are more likely to hang out and turn those acquaintances into friends.

868
01:17:30,467 --> 01:17:33,549
Speaker 0: And then by the time you're ready to go on the job point, you ultimately won.

869
01:17:34,386 --> 01:17:40,331
Speaker 0: hundreds of people that you've interacted with over the past year, that you could go to and say, hey, you saw me where I was.

870
01:17:40,431 --> 01:17:41,472
Speaker 0: Here's where I'm at now.

871
01:17:41,893 --> 01:17:42,973
Speaker 0: Who should I talk to?

872
01:17:42,993 --> 01:17:44,175
Speaker 0: I'm looking for a job.

873
01:17:44,515 --> 01:17:46,016
Speaker 0: And that's really successful for people.

874
01:17:46,096 --> 01:17:47,658
Speaker 0: So that's phase one of networking.

875
01:17:47,678 --> 01:17:49,899
Speaker 0: Phase two is once you go on the hunt.

876
01:17:50,180 --> 01:17:51,201
Speaker 0: It's very targeted.

877
01:17:51,281 --> 01:17:55,684
Speaker 0: We call it building our hit list where we identify the companies that are actively hiring.

878
01:17:56,736 --> 01:18:03,706
Speaker 0: identify like three to five people in each of those companies and we're doing outreach to getting communication with those folks.

879
01:18:03,786 --> 01:18:16,904
Speaker 0: learn more and what we're finding is that a lot of jobs just don't get posted A lot of times folks will be applying for one job that they wind up getting a different one just because they like the person.

880
01:18:17,565 --> 01:18:23,450
Speaker 0: We have this idea that tech is this meritocracy where if you know the skills, you get the job, it's not.

881
01:18:23,470 --> 01:18:34,461
Speaker 0: So people want to work with people that they like, they want to work with people that they know and trust and you can make that happen for yourself by really kind of going this networking your way in pathway.

882
01:18:36,112 --> 01:18:38,914
Speaker 1: So the term meritocracy is.

883
01:18:39,635 --> 01:18:44,038
Speaker 1: it was like actually like a joke because the author was like.

884
01:18:44,058 --> 01:18:44,799
Speaker 1: this doesn't exist.

885
01:18:44,819 --> 01:18:45,860
Speaker 1: This is absurd.

886
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:48,682
Speaker 1: Like it's who you know it.

887
01:18:48,702 --> 01:18:54,227
Speaker 1: like your skill unless you're I mean even like the most demonstrably good pianists.

888
01:18:54,667 --> 01:18:56,909
Speaker 1: for example to talk about pianists we talked about it earlier.

889
01:18:57,469 --> 01:19:14,804
Speaker 1: like somebody saw, you know, um, skill in them and like help them get absurd, you know, enrolled in some observatory or they had that time to play piano a lot with all the other kids were working in the few factory, you know, in the, you know, industrial revolution or whatever, like it takes.

890
01:19:16,045 --> 01:19:18,327
Speaker 1: So everybody circumstances are different.

891
01:19:18,387 --> 01:19:28,674
Speaker 1: So I just want to, like, put the bed, because I've never talked about this on the podcast, but we don't use the word meritocracy on here, except to say that things aren't meritocracy because they are.

892
01:19:28,934 --> 01:19:29,474
Speaker 1: It's really good.

893
01:19:29,494 --> 01:19:30,255
Speaker 1: It's the thing that they are.

894
01:19:31,015 --> 01:19:35,899
Speaker 1: The person who came up with it, I think, in a book was like just joking about it.

895
01:19:35,919 --> 01:19:36,559
Speaker 1: Yeah.

896
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:45,163
Speaker 1: But he defined meritocracy is like, I think effort and intelligence.

897
01:19:45,683 --> 01:19:47,664
Speaker 1: And how do you build intelligence?

898
01:19:47,684 --> 01:19:48,545
Speaker 1: through effort, right?

899
01:19:48,605 --> 01:19:52,546
Speaker 1: Some of it may be like, you know, endowed upon you.

900
01:19:53,407 --> 01:19:55,928
Speaker 1: But for most part, we all work really hard.

901
01:19:56,008 --> 01:19:59,009
Speaker 1: I study, you know, foreign languages like an hour a day.

902
01:19:59,069 --> 01:20:00,590
Speaker 1: I play bass an hour a day.

903
01:20:01,531 --> 01:20:06,873
Speaker 1: And I'm like, I still suck at those things, but sucking at something is the first step to being good at something.

904
01:20:07,213 --> 01:20:07,413
Speaker 0: Right.

905
01:20:08,313 --> 01:20:12,974
Speaker 1: So I also wanted to describe or like define like an acronym.

906
01:20:13,354 --> 01:20:17,495
Speaker 1: A T S is applicant tracking system system.

907
01:20:17,875 --> 01:20:18,075
Speaker 0: Yeah.

908
01:20:18,115 --> 01:20:22,096
Speaker 1: When you apply through like a web form, you're like applying into some algorithms.

909
01:20:22,116 --> 01:20:33,178
Speaker 1: that can be like, OK, we didn't ask if they have a college degree because it's hip to say that we don't look for people who have college degrees, but in reality, our system is going to just filter you out because you don't have a college degree.

910
01:20:33,238 --> 01:20:43,488
Speaker 1: We didn't put it on the thing, but you know I think I heard some study that like it was a recent study like 700 job postings that didn't say they required a degree.

911
01:20:43,528 --> 01:20:53,598
Speaker 1: like zero people got those jobs for software engineering for those roles even though they didn't say because If you don't have a degree, the ATS just simply filters you out.

912
01:20:53,618 --> 01:20:55,058
Speaker 1: No human ever even reviews it, right?

913
01:20:55,479 --> 01:21:02,782
Speaker 1: But like the way I got my first job as a developer was through meetup.com, going to like local Ruby developer, meetup.

914
01:21:03,122 --> 01:21:04,423
Speaker 1: And I got a job as a Rails developer.

915
01:21:04,523 --> 01:21:06,384
Speaker 1: And the interview was very similar.

916
01:21:06,644 --> 01:21:12,087
Speaker 1: Maybe you can describe the typical interview, the hundred devs folks go through because it's not like a lead code white board.

917
01:21:12,467 --> 01:21:16,209
Speaker 1: Maybe some of them, but a lot of it is like, hey, I've already seen your projects.

918
01:21:16,749 --> 01:21:17,470
Speaker 1: I know you can code.

919
01:21:17,610 --> 01:21:17,870
Speaker 1: Yeah.

920
01:21:17,930 --> 01:21:19,531
Speaker 1: Are you a good fit for our organization, right?

921
01:21:20,171 --> 01:21:21,693
Speaker 0: It's about 50, 50.

922
01:21:21,693 --> 01:21:21,933
Speaker 1: Yeah.

923
01:21:22,093 --> 01:21:26,798
Speaker 0: We're talking across hundreds of people that have gotten jobs that I've literally seen, right?

924
01:21:27,098 --> 01:21:29,440
Speaker 0: And people have come and talked about them during our huddle.

925
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:37,729
Speaker 0: So we have a celebrations channel on our discord, where you can go through and see hundreds of people, their stories, how they got the jobs with the interviews we're like.

926
01:21:37,749 --> 01:21:39,510
Speaker 0: And so that's really powerful to know that.

927
01:21:40,211 --> 01:21:41,492
Speaker 0: But it's about 50, 50.

928
01:21:41,492 --> 01:21:49,075
Speaker 0: And it's when they, when they do an interview, We're talking about sometimes there's not going to be like a lead code style portion.

929
01:21:49,095 --> 01:21:51,275
Speaker 0: There's still going to be behavioral questions.

930
01:21:51,615 --> 01:21:53,275
Speaker 0: There's still going to be technical questions.

931
01:21:53,296 --> 01:21:55,076
Speaker 0: There's still going to be walking through a project.

932
01:21:55,376 --> 01:22:02,637
Speaker 0: You might do some light like coding together, but for about half the folks that have got jobs, they haven't done like a lead code style question.

933
01:22:02,657 --> 01:22:06,038
Speaker 0: The other half you will, and then there's varying degrees of it.

934
01:22:06,418 --> 01:22:13,924
Speaker 0: And so so many folks focus on like grinding out lead code until their eyes bleed and they're just like Yeah, if you're going for Fang, sure, that needs to be the thing that you do.

935
01:22:14,305 --> 01:22:25,430
Speaker 0: But if you're going for a local health care company in your medium-sized city, They're probably not going to know, like, they're probably not going to go through and do that level of interviewing.

936
01:22:25,951 --> 01:22:32,175
Speaker 0: And so one of the things we always say is, like, don't go into interviews like an accident, always ask what you're about to walk into.

937
01:22:32,356 --> 01:22:41,342
Speaker 0: They'll tell you, like, almost every single time, if you just say, like, hey, like, I'm putting a lot of time and energy into this application, I would really appreciate just being fully prepared.

938
01:22:41,422 --> 01:22:43,203
Speaker 0: What am I about to walk into in this interview?

939
01:22:43,564 --> 01:22:46,286
Speaker 0: And they'll tell you, oh, you're just going to meet with so-and-so and talk through a project.

940
01:22:46,346 --> 01:22:46,566
Speaker 0: Great.

941
01:22:47,006 --> 01:22:48,406
Speaker 0: Now you know how to prep for that interview.

942
01:22:48,506 --> 01:22:51,247
Speaker 0: Don't ever go into an interview if you don't know what you're about to walk into.

943
01:22:51,667 --> 01:22:59,449
Speaker 0: It's about half of our jobs have been not really needing some of those more aggressive skills, but it's a huge smell test.

944
01:22:59,489 --> 01:23:00,429
Speaker 0: It's a sniff test.

945
01:23:01,009 --> 01:23:03,930
Speaker 0: We like to say every single person that starts off at 100 dev smells.

946
01:23:04,690 --> 01:23:10,171
Speaker 0: There's something about you that's going to stop you from getting the job and it's your job to like figure out what it is.

947
01:23:10,331 --> 01:23:19,656
Speaker 0: Get rid of the smell and make sure you come across as a who will confident professional that's done this been there and is ready to get to work.

948
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:23,818
Speaker 0: And if you can do that, you're gonna be really successful getting jobs.

949
01:23:23,938 --> 01:23:30,381
Speaker 0: And even folks that wanna go the other more traditional interviews with like the leaked codes and things like that, you're still passing a sniff test.

950
01:23:30,861 --> 01:23:39,205
Speaker 0: I have seen folks that I consider just amazing, even done like competitive programming that do well in interviews and don't get the job and they wonder why.

951
01:23:39,245 --> 01:23:42,086
Speaker 0: And then you look at the resume and you look at how they present themselves.

952
01:23:42,546 --> 01:23:44,867
Speaker 0: They're narrative, all that stuff matters.

953
01:23:45,347 --> 01:23:46,248
Speaker 0: It really matters.

954
01:23:46,268 --> 01:23:49,289
Speaker 0: You need to invest time and opening that stuff, those doors as well.

955
01:23:49,649 --> 01:23:50,629
Speaker 1: Yeah, absolutely.

956
01:23:50,969 --> 01:23:57,292
Speaker 1: And I just want to emphasize, like, if you can figure out what that smell is, maybe it's that I don't have a degree.

957
01:23:57,372 --> 01:24:04,455
Speaker 1: And like, I'm getting filtered out of ATS, or people are just not looking at me as a serious, like, a serious candidate just based on that virtue.

958
01:24:04,715 --> 01:24:06,196
Speaker 1: You can absolutely correct for that.

959
01:24:06,216 --> 01:24:09,197
Speaker 1: And I have lots of friends, like, like, a lot of people in the free code campaign.

960
01:24:09,777 --> 01:24:11,959
Speaker 1: dropped out of college or never went to college, right?

961
01:24:13,039 --> 01:24:26,048
Speaker 1: And it's just one of those things where you had to figure out like an empathize with like the HR person, whoever you're talking to and figure out what is their their specific for because usually they're just trying to figure out a way to quickly weed people out.

962
01:24:26,889 --> 01:24:28,650
Speaker 1: So to speak, so they're like, why don't you know like?

963
01:24:30,231 --> 01:24:35,958
Speaker 0: I don't know, one of the things we're trying to really hard to understand is make sure you know all the hacks and the secrets and what's really happening.

964
01:24:35,998 --> 01:24:43,247
Speaker 0: and so recruiters are using some sort of like we said ATS, some sort of filter, you know what the adds to your resume to get past those filters.

965
01:24:43,588 --> 01:24:47,473
Speaker 0: We use things like CV compiler which is like a website that will tell you what you're missing.

966
01:24:48,113 --> 01:24:49,754
Speaker 0: We have like our own resume template.

967
01:24:49,774 --> 01:24:50,974
Speaker 0: that's like battle tested.

968
01:24:51,314 --> 01:24:53,615
Speaker 0: We follow like the true F shape pattern.

969
01:24:53,635 --> 01:25:02,559
Speaker 0: Like if you watch recruiters with eye tracking as a video that's going really popular is done it again where we like watch the way they look they read left the right like most folks that read English.

970
01:25:02,819 --> 01:25:06,741
Speaker 0: They're looking for those specific keywords at the front load of the F shape pattern right.

971
01:25:06,961 --> 01:25:08,161
Speaker 0: So if you know these things you can.

972
01:25:08,602 --> 01:25:13,284
Speaker 0: you can get past these, like, screen segments.

973
01:25:13,645 --> 01:25:16,967
Speaker 0: And the other thing is people really need to work on how they talk about themselves.

974
01:25:17,647 --> 01:25:20,289
Speaker 0: People go into the hunt too humble.

975
01:25:20,809 --> 01:25:26,353
Speaker 0: This is like your one chance in life to talk, your talk, be proud of your previous experience.

976
01:25:26,373 --> 01:25:38,281
Speaker 0: I don't care what you've done, having that prior experience, but previous experience makes you a badass and brings different skills to the table than someone that did a four year CS has only ever worked in computer science.

977
01:25:39,722 --> 01:25:54,928
Speaker 0: You're different and that difference can be a value add to a lot of companies and so knowing how to craft that into a narrative, like a logical reason from what you were doing to why you're the best software engineer they have in their candidate pool and being able to talk about yourself highly is super important.

978
01:25:54,968 --> 01:25:56,948
Speaker 0: So if you're listening, what is your narrative?

979
01:25:56,968 --> 01:25:57,729
Speaker 0: What is your story?

980
01:25:58,009 --> 01:25:59,969
Speaker 0: Why are you the coolest thing since sliced bread?

981
01:26:00,009 --> 01:26:01,330
Speaker 0: walking into that interview?

982
01:26:01,350 --> 01:26:16,859
Speaker 0: That's what we do a lot during our huddles and 100 does we have whole nights where we just craft stories, we'll have dozens of people come up to give us their life history and we craft the narrative live and then you just see an instant difference and how they're going through applications.

983
01:26:17,499 --> 01:26:17,699
Speaker 1: Yeah.

984
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:25,024
Speaker 1: And so first of all, I would love if you can share the links to those, the CD, I'll pull up CD compassion.

985
01:26:25,044 --> 01:26:26,565
Speaker 1: Like via resume template.

986
01:26:27,246 --> 01:26:33,750
Speaker 1: And like we've talked a lot about 100 and I feel like we could talk a whole lot more.

987
01:26:33,770 --> 01:26:35,912
Speaker 1: First of all, I want to make sure you still have a few minutes.

988
01:26:36,112 --> 01:26:37,914
Speaker 0: I'm gonna finish the go for as long as you have me.

989
01:26:38,314 --> 01:26:39,455
Speaker 1: Oh, well, that's great news.

990
01:26:42,337 --> 01:26:47,342
Speaker 1: The main limit is going to be the fact that I've drifted like literally like two liters of tea while I was sitting here talking with you.

991
01:26:47,662 --> 01:26:49,123
Speaker 1: So I think I have to go to the bathroom at some point.

992
01:26:49,384 --> 01:26:58,011
Speaker 1: But what we what I really want is just a tease out as many like high level insights that we can get into this podcast like.

993
01:26:58,031 --> 01:27:09,596
Speaker 1: I just want to end on as many pieces of actual advice, as you can share, as somebody who has become a developer, it's worked as a software engineer who's even built a successful project.

994
01:27:09,616 --> 01:27:23,085
Speaker 1: I guess three or two projects and then you're very actively high up in resilient coders too, which sounds like a really, and I want to tease as many of those out of you as I can, for the benefit of the audience.

995
01:27:23,205 --> 01:27:26,227
Speaker 1: And for the benefit of myself, I've been seriously taking notes through this whole thing.

996
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:35,627
Speaker 1: Some questions I have are, I guess, what are some questions I should be asking?

997
01:27:35,988 --> 01:27:45,058
Speaker 1: Well, some interesting things that people never ask you that are really helpful, that would be helpful for the many people out there learning the code.

998
01:27:45,579 --> 01:27:45,739
Speaker 1: What?

999
01:27:46,340 --> 01:27:47,741
Speaker 1: Okay, what is a big mistake?

1000
01:27:48,582 --> 01:27:49,443
Speaker 1: We can think about that.

1001
01:27:49,463 --> 01:27:50,864
Speaker 1: Maybe you can think of some other things.

1002
01:27:50,904 --> 01:28:03,374
Speaker 1: But what are the big mistake that you see developers make other than, you know, over-optimizing on their skills, for example, and not enough on their network of the reputation or figuring out how to empathize with recruiters.

1003
01:28:03,414 --> 01:28:09,478
Speaker 1: And I don't mean like, you buddies with them, but like, you always want to understand other people's perspectives.

1004
01:28:09,518 --> 01:28:28,550
Speaker 1: There's no disadvantage to having more perspectives kind of compact in your head, being able to build with more versatility models of other people and how they're approaching the world and what they're looking for, how you can find the job that needs to be done and you can do it for that person, right?

1005
01:28:28,570 --> 01:28:33,772
Speaker 0: You know, I guess I'll gear it towards folks that are like learning how to code and trying to get a job.

1006
01:28:34,253 --> 01:28:43,977
Speaker 0: I think the biggest mistake outside of the things like not investing early in networking and over investing in things that aren't going to really move the needle in terms of you getting a job is there's.

1007
01:28:44,037 --> 01:28:49,360
Speaker 0: there's two things that I think lead to most folks not being successful.

1008
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:54,042
Speaker 0: And the number one thing is going into your day is like an accident.

1009
01:28:55,142 --> 01:29:03,806
Speaker 0: If you're going into your day is like an accident and you don't have a game plan for your day, your week, your month and you're trying to commit to a process is going to take years.

1010
01:29:04,506 --> 01:29:05,627
Speaker 0: You're not going to be successful.

1011
01:29:06,247 --> 01:29:12,910
Speaker 0: And I've worked from where folks from all different walks of life, the folks that make a plan for what they want, like what do you want for yourself?

1012
01:29:13,550 --> 01:29:14,590
Speaker 0: What do you want for your family?

1013
01:29:14,610 --> 01:29:15,751
Speaker 0: What do you want for your loved ones?

1014
01:29:15,771 --> 01:29:17,031
Speaker 0: Like, what do you want?

1015
01:29:17,631 --> 01:29:20,332
Speaker 0: And then what are the steps you're going to take to get there?

1016
01:29:20,732 --> 01:29:28,354
Speaker 0: That plan helps you get through the trough of sorrow, helps you get through the days where you don't have motivation when the discipline is fleeting.

1017
01:29:30,555 --> 01:29:32,958
Speaker 0: How do you stay true to like what you want?

1018
01:29:32,978 --> 01:29:34,160
Speaker 0: and you should have it written down.

1019
01:29:34,180 --> 01:29:35,221
Speaker 0: you should have it on your wall.

1020
01:29:35,261 --> 01:29:35,942
Speaker 0: you should you should.

1021
01:29:36,182 --> 01:29:43,190
Speaker 0: there's a reason why I have your photo is like the background of my wall paper every once in a while is because I need to know what I'm shooting for and like.

1022
01:29:43,210 --> 01:29:43,831
Speaker 0: what do I want?

1023
01:29:43,851 --> 01:29:54,360
Speaker 0: like what I want for myself but I want for my community and like having that why go, everyone that's trying to learn code needs to go on some long walks with no podcasts, no music, no anything.

1024
01:29:54,721 --> 01:29:56,162
Speaker 0: And just ask yourself, what do I want?

1025
01:29:56,202 --> 01:29:57,002
Speaker 0: Like, what's my future?

1026
01:29:57,022 --> 01:29:58,223
Speaker 0: Like, what do I want for myself?

1027
01:29:58,563 --> 01:30:02,126
Speaker 0: Because until you have that, it's really hard to push through.

1028
01:30:02,166 --> 01:30:07,849
Speaker 0: And so I have a lot of people that come and they say they want it, but they only kind of want it, right?

1029
01:30:08,010 --> 01:30:11,232
Speaker 0: It's like a very famous doctor at Thomas speech, like they just kind of want it.

1030
01:30:11,792 --> 01:30:21,518
Speaker 0: And until you really want it, and that can come from a lot of different ways, and come from being fucking hungry, it can come from wanting their respect of your family, like it can come from a lot of different places.

1031
01:30:21,878 --> 01:30:24,500
Speaker 0: But until you have that, you're not gonna, you're not gonna make it through.

1032
01:30:25,621 --> 01:30:35,527
Speaker 0: And yeah, so having that hammered down and really having it visible, putting it somewhere on the wall, like knowing what it is, and then every day.

1033
01:30:36,664 --> 01:30:40,005
Speaker 0: Before I go to bed, I write up the three things I want to get done the next day.

1034
01:30:40,805 --> 01:30:42,666
Speaker 0: Once a month, I would have my goals for the month.

1035
01:30:43,286 --> 01:30:46,927
Speaker 0: Once a year, like, when I went to every couple of months, like, when am I trying to get done for the year?

1036
01:30:47,507 --> 01:30:48,968
Speaker 0: And I hold myself to it.

1037
01:30:49,328 --> 01:30:53,009
Speaker 0: And the last piece I'll say about this is I get buying from the folks that matter most to me.

1038
01:30:53,629 --> 01:30:54,849
Speaker 0: So it's not something eternal to me.

1039
01:30:54,869 --> 01:30:56,830
Speaker 0: Like, I know if I want to be successful in this.

1040
01:30:57,390 --> 01:31:00,471
Speaker 0: I need to get the buying of my wife, right?

1041
01:31:00,931 --> 01:31:02,211
Speaker 0: Hey, this is the thing I want to do.

1042
01:31:02,772 --> 01:31:03,772
Speaker 0: It's going to take a lot of time.

1043
01:31:04,795 --> 01:31:19,789
Speaker 0: It's going to take some nights and weekends away from us being together and with our family and I need you to understand why I'm doing it, why it's important and can I have a little bit of your trust and I'll prove that to you over time that it's worthwhile investment.

1044
01:31:20,129 --> 01:31:28,336
Speaker 0: but I need you to know why I'm doing this and get that by and Because we don't have that buying, especially if you're like, stay still at home with family.

1045
01:31:28,376 --> 01:31:29,237
Speaker 0: that doesn't get it.

1046
01:31:29,657 --> 01:31:36,262
Speaker 0: If you're not being as present with your loved ones, that's going to build up some resentment.

1047
01:31:36,723 --> 01:31:39,245
Speaker 0: And for a lot of folks, it's another reason why they're not successful.

1048
01:31:39,325 --> 01:31:41,346
Speaker 0: So yeah, I'm going to go into your days like an accident.

1049
01:31:41,486 --> 01:31:42,627
Speaker 0: Have a plan for your days.

1050
01:31:43,068 --> 01:31:45,670
Speaker 0: Know what your why is and get buying from the folks that matter most.

1051
01:31:46,564 --> 01:31:51,847
Speaker 1: Yeah, that getting by and it's so important because learning to cause a long, long journey.

1052
01:31:52,027 --> 01:31:59,991
Speaker 1: And you get all hyped up, you get all these, you know, probably YouTube ads or ads on the side of your coding tutorials.

1053
01:32:00,351 --> 01:32:05,634
Speaker 1: Learn to code in just three months and get a job being like, do 100k, like, you know, whatever.

1054
01:32:07,515 --> 01:32:07,895
Speaker 1: to be fair.

1055
01:32:07,915 --> 01:32:12,640
Speaker 1: There are plenty of developers who do learn to code very quickly and do get jobs.

1056
01:32:13,521 --> 01:32:23,630
Speaker 1: I've had lots of friends who transitioned from working on Wall Street and they went to some expensive intensive coding program and they were able to then go get a job in Silicon Valley.

1057
01:32:23,990 --> 01:32:25,512
Speaker 1: But they already had college degrees.

1058
01:32:26,232 --> 01:32:29,955
Speaker 1: They already had, you know, like They probably figured out how to plan.

1059
01:32:30,955 --> 01:32:37,697
Speaker 1: They probably had an understanding of learning techniques that we've been talking about.

1060
01:32:38,558 --> 01:32:45,140
Speaker 1: Most importantly, they had a lot of money and they were able to focus on it exclusively and attend an intensive in person bootcamp.

1061
01:32:46,100 --> 01:32:47,241
Speaker 1: That error may have passed.

1062
01:32:47,521 --> 01:32:49,121
Speaker 1: It may be that it's just a little harder now.

1063
01:32:50,962 --> 01:32:53,704
Speaker 1: to be able to get a job just because you should learn math, right?

1064
01:32:53,744 --> 01:33:00,307
Speaker 1: Like, you used to be back in the day, you could just learn some WordPress and you could probably go get some clients new WordPress work.

1065
01:33:00,367 --> 01:33:05,650
Speaker 1: And it may be that case, but with the global market and the level of competition you're going to get from places like India.

1066
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:19,053
Speaker 1: Nigeria, China, like tons of extremely educated, extremely hungry people are coming from all these places and you know frankly they're getting your lunch if you're not putting in the time and effort to.

1067
01:33:19,354 --> 01:33:23,015
Speaker 1: Benjamin Franklin said few people plan to fail.

1068
01:33:23,455 --> 01:33:26,439
Speaker 1: most people who fail fail the plan.

1069
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:27,760
Speaker 1: That's a paraphrase.

1070
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:28,460
Speaker 1: What do you say?

1071
01:33:28,580 --> 01:33:29,801
Speaker 1: It's not anything that's perfect.

1072
01:33:30,141 --> 01:33:32,142
Speaker 1: But it is like 100% with Leon's saying here.

1073
01:33:33,862 --> 01:33:38,965
Speaker 1: And yeah, so I just want to emphasize like getting buy in from your family, like when I learned to code.

1074
01:33:38,985 --> 01:33:41,606
Speaker 1: Again, I don't want to make this all about me, but like.

1075
01:33:42,706 --> 01:33:47,030
Speaker 1: I told my wife, like, hey, I've got this job as a school director, right?

1076
01:33:47,110 --> 01:33:49,291
Speaker 1: And I would like to become a software engineer.

1077
01:33:49,972 --> 01:33:55,937
Speaker 1: And we had double income, we had insurance, which is a huge deal here in the US through her work.

1078
01:33:56,777 --> 01:33:59,760
Speaker 1: So even if I left my job, we could continue to have health insurance.

1079
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:02,863
Speaker 1: And I just grind it every single day and I ever.

1080
01:34:03,223 --> 01:34:05,465
Speaker 1: I did precisely what you're talking about planning out.

1081
01:34:05,605 --> 01:34:07,527
Speaker 1: Okay, what am I gonna accomplish next few days?

1082
01:34:07,847 --> 01:34:09,488
Speaker 1: Because planning is everything like.

1083
01:34:09,809 --> 01:34:17,976
Speaker 1: it's so important to have a plan and to stick to a plan and to have goals that are miserable and then are within your control.

1084
01:34:17,996 --> 01:34:32,149
Speaker 1: That's another mistake I see a lot of people make is people will be like my goal is to get you know 100,000 YouTube subscribers this year or my goal is to get you know a job paying like $1,000 or to get in freelance files.

1085
01:34:32,529 --> 01:34:35,332
Speaker 1: You know those are not things that you can directly control.

1086
01:34:36,030 --> 01:34:38,852
Speaker 1: You can't control the outcome, but you can control the input.

1087
01:34:39,273 --> 01:34:45,978
Speaker 1: My goal is to, my base for an hour a day, or whatever goal I might have at any given moment.

1088
01:34:46,018 --> 01:34:53,083
Speaker 0: James Clear of atomic habits has that very famous quote that I love so much that we don't rise to the level of our goals.

1089
01:34:53,123 --> 01:34:54,845
Speaker 0: We fall to the levels of our systems.

1090
01:34:55,385 --> 01:35:09,101
Speaker 0: And so this idea, like we have all these lofty goals, but if you're not putting in the systems, the how do you play the base for an hour each day, study your languages for an hour each day and the process for that, it's just not going to work out for you in the long run.

1091
01:35:09,921 --> 01:35:10,342
Speaker 1: Absolutely.

1092
01:35:12,952 --> 01:35:16,156
Speaker 1: We've talked a lot in, of course, you and I, we grew up in the U.S.

1093
01:35:16,336 --> 01:35:18,038
Speaker 1: Europe and Philly, I grew up in Oklahoma City.

1094
01:35:19,259 --> 01:35:20,941
Speaker 1: And here in the U.S.

1095
01:35:21,182 --> 01:35:26,328
Speaker 1: even though things are not equal by a long shot, it's very unequal society.

1096
01:35:26,768 --> 01:35:31,473
Speaker 1: We still have vestiges of, you know, history.

1097
01:35:32,393 --> 01:35:33,834
Speaker 1: Going back 400 years, right?

1098
01:35:34,274 --> 01:35:38,855
Speaker 1: Like the warp, essentially the halves and the have knots.

1099
01:35:41,156 --> 01:35:46,317
Speaker 1: But in the US, we're pretty well off compared to folks in a lot of countries.

1100
01:35:47,157 --> 01:35:57,960
Speaker 1: For example, like the hyper competition in places like India and China where you've got like so many people getting like CS degrees and trying to compete and so few employers.

1101
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:08,803
Speaker 1: or Nigeria, where there are so many amazing developers, like I think it's like the third or fourth largest community in free co-camp, people that use free co-camp is Nigeria.

1102
01:36:09,143 --> 01:36:11,784
Speaker 1: But if you look at Nigeria, there aren't a lot of big employers.

1103
01:36:12,404 --> 01:36:13,904
Speaker 1: And the government's kind of a mess.

1104
01:36:14,444 --> 01:36:17,385
Speaker 1: And as a result, there's not a lot of opportunity, even though there's a lot of talent.

1105
01:36:17,445 --> 01:36:25,027
Speaker 1: So a lot of those people have to move overseas, so like Europe or to the United States, or wherever they can find opportunity, right?

1106
01:36:25,527 --> 01:36:31,329
Speaker 1: Like a lot of the What is the proportion of people doing 100 devs who are outside of the US?

1107
01:36:31,549 --> 01:36:36,711
Speaker 1: And what have you observed about those people that might be helpful for them?

1108
01:36:38,472 --> 01:36:47,234
Speaker 1: Yeah, and like just a follow-up question will take on is like, do they need to move to the US to be able to be successful in software engineering or other paths that you've seen people succeed with?

1109
01:36:47,314 --> 01:36:51,876
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I would say about half our community is from the US and about half is from everywhere else.

1110
01:36:52,316 --> 01:36:54,839
Speaker 0: In fact, the first jobs we ever got were not from the US.

1111
01:36:54,859 --> 01:37:00,326
Speaker 0: They were from Brazil, then Poland, UK, and then a bunch of other places in South America.

1112
01:37:01,027 --> 01:37:06,273
Speaker 0: And so a lot of our community in folks that have that in jobs haven't been from the US centric.

1113
01:37:06,353 --> 01:37:15,738
Speaker 0: And so the first thing I always say is whenever somebody from outside the US says I want to get a job, And just tell them bluntly, it's way harder.

1114
01:37:16,459 --> 01:37:21,741
Speaker 0: Don't let anyone convince you that it's going to be the same pathway, somebody from the US, it's going to be a way more difficult journey.

1115
01:37:22,082 --> 01:37:25,523
Speaker 0: And there's a very couple of very key things that you have to keep in mind.

1116
01:37:26,624 --> 01:37:31,446
Speaker 0: One, the visa sponsorship issue in the United States is wild.

1117
01:37:31,566 --> 01:37:33,828
Speaker 0: It goes to a lottery most years, right?

1118
01:37:34,288 --> 01:37:37,710
Speaker 0: And so banking on that is like a pathway into an engineering career.

1119
01:37:37,770 --> 01:37:42,173
Speaker 0: if you're from a area that doesn't have like that strong of a local tech economy is very hard.

1120
01:37:42,733 --> 01:37:47,116
Speaker 0: The competition for companies that hire remotely is brutal.

1121
01:37:47,577 --> 01:37:50,719
Speaker 0: It's even more brutal when you look at the companies that hire globally.

1122
01:37:50,839 --> 01:37:52,820
Speaker 0: So a lot of people think, oh, I'll get a remote tech job.

1123
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:58,324
Speaker 0: No, even though they're remote, they only hire folks from the US or from a very specific select countries.

1124
01:37:58,785 --> 01:38:06,437
Speaker 0: So finding a group of folks that hire globally remotely, that's a very narrow pool.

1125
01:38:06,838 --> 01:38:11,160
Speaker 0: So the first thing I recommend that you do is build a hit list of those companies.

1126
01:38:11,180 --> 01:38:12,581
Speaker 0: They're at least you can find online.

1127
01:38:12,941 --> 01:38:15,183
Speaker 0: There are a couple hundred of those companies.

1128
01:38:15,783 --> 01:38:17,864
Speaker 0: You need to be best friends with everybody that works at that company.

1129
01:38:18,064 --> 01:38:20,246
Speaker 0: And you mentioned building your reputation.

1130
01:38:20,306 --> 01:38:26,309
Speaker 0: This is something I really recommend folks that are coming from a location that has a traditional tech economy.

1131
01:38:26,730 --> 01:38:28,291
Speaker 0: Is your reputation matters a lot?

1132
01:38:29,131 --> 01:38:31,433
Speaker 0: We talk about building authority a lot in a hundred dev.

1133
01:38:31,473 --> 01:38:36,698
Speaker 0: So picking a niche or a topic that you know very very well, generating content around it.

1134
01:38:36,718 --> 01:38:39,220
Speaker 0: So once somebody thinks about, I don't know, authentication.

1135
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:43,604
Speaker 0: They think about you and the blog post you've written and the depth of knowledge that you can bring.

1136
01:38:43,964 --> 01:38:48,989
Speaker 0: That way when you're applying to these global remote companies, you have something that nobody else really has.

1137
01:38:49,089 --> 01:38:51,531
Speaker 0: It's like intangible thing that helps set you apart.

1138
01:38:51,931 --> 01:38:53,392
Speaker 0: And so the first thing I say is harder.

1139
01:38:54,261 --> 01:38:59,806
Speaker 0: Building authority or reputation is super important and not going into your job search like an accident.

1140
01:38:59,866 --> 01:39:09,736
Speaker 0: It's not going to happen if you don't have a very strong game plan and you're building the references and helping pass that sniff test that these companies are putting out there.

1141
01:39:09,776 --> 01:39:13,519
Speaker 0: If you do those things, you'll be successfully filled hundreds of people in that situation and get a job.

1142
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:15,281
Speaker 0: It's just a way more difficult pathway.

1143
01:39:16,041 --> 01:39:26,327
Speaker 1: Yeah and just on that note of like building authority like what are some of the most I guess immediate things someone can do let's say you already have.

1144
01:39:26,347 --> 01:39:35,872
Speaker 1: this goes let's say you've been coding for a long time and you just want to be able to get a job preferably like a multinational company many of which are of course US based.

1145
01:39:37,333 --> 01:39:50,182
Speaker 1: And you would love over the next five or ten years to eventually get a visa and come to the US where salaries are double what they are in Europe and where we have a high degree of freedom that people in other countries don't necessarily enjoy.

1146
01:39:50,542 --> 01:39:53,725
Speaker 1: I mean, it is a good place to live, like living in the US.

1147
01:39:54,205 --> 01:39:54,405
Speaker 1: Right.

1148
01:39:54,765 --> 01:40:06,929
Speaker 1: I guess it's easy for me to say that it's like a middle class guy who speaks English natively and has US citizenship and doesn't have to deal with like my H1B, you know, being shifted around and like getting companies responsible for me and all that stuff.

1149
01:40:06,949 --> 01:40:09,509
Speaker 1: But like I can definitely understand the appeal.

1150
01:40:09,549 --> 01:40:15,191
Speaker 1: I can understand why so many people are trying, you know, to immigrate to the US every day.

1151
01:40:15,271 --> 01:40:21,413
Speaker 1: But like what would be some practical ways that they can establish authority, as you said?

1152
01:40:22,313 --> 01:40:41,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I think when you are trying to stand out amongst lots of other talented individuals, doesn't have to be anything wild, I really do think building a list of companies that are on your targeted range and the H&B processes, I've helped sponsor a lot of H&Bs.

1153
01:40:42,731 --> 01:40:45,053
Speaker 0: We can talk about, like, that's a whole other beast in it itself.

1154
01:40:45,133 --> 01:40:47,534
Speaker 0: That's like, you have to be at an exceptional talent.

1155
01:40:47,554 --> 01:40:48,315
Speaker 0: You have to do these things.

1156
01:40:48,355 --> 01:40:49,115
Speaker 0: That was your standout.

1157
01:40:49,135 --> 01:40:50,036
Speaker 0: Like, that's a whole thing.

1158
01:40:50,376 --> 01:40:51,777
Speaker 0: You're talking about, like, global remote company.

1159
01:40:51,797 --> 01:40:52,498
Speaker 0: Like, what can you do right now?

1160
01:40:52,518 --> 01:40:56,280
Speaker 0: Think about somebody that's right now that wants to, to get a job.

1161
01:40:56,460 --> 01:41:00,924
Speaker 0: My, my process probably wouldn't be the H1B coming to the US right away.

1162
01:41:00,944 --> 01:41:03,325
Speaker 0: It'd be these, like, global remote companies.

1163
01:41:03,725 --> 01:41:06,527
Speaker 0: And then maybe expanding the companies that could sponsor.

1164
01:41:07,568 --> 01:41:12,231
Speaker 0: But a lot of times, you're going to need more more credentials you're going to need like.

1165
01:41:12,251 --> 01:41:15,291
Speaker 0: the degrees might actually become a thing if you're trying to go that sponsorship route.

1166
01:41:16,092 --> 01:41:33,018
Speaker 0: so I recommend right now if you're someone in Nigeria or India looking at these global higher and remote companies figuring out what they do building a list of them building a list of all the people that you know that work there adding them to a Twitter list, right?

1167
01:41:33,058 --> 01:41:46,688
Speaker 0: Like each person, either to a Twitter list, start engaging with their content, just liking stuff at first, don't be spammy, don't be weird, just like engaging with them, liking their content, congratulating them when they get a new project built, right?

1168
01:41:46,728 --> 01:41:52,732
Speaker 0: Like building that network of folks that know who you are over time, like you become like an acquaintance.

1169
01:41:52,752 --> 01:42:02,379
Speaker 0: Like you can go from a nobody to like they have no idea who you are to an acquaintance, just by regular interaction on LinkedIn, Twitter, And there's a fine line between being weird with it, right?

1170
01:42:02,699 --> 01:42:03,920
Speaker 0: I don't know how to do this joke.

1171
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:04,700
Speaker 0: It's not stalking.

1172
01:42:04,740 --> 01:42:05,421
Speaker 0: It's networking.

1173
01:42:05,761 --> 01:42:08,362
Speaker 0: And so we're going to make sure that you're not crossing that line.

1174
01:42:10,043 --> 01:42:14,166
Speaker 0: And then starting to realize what these companies have trouble with, right?

1175
01:42:14,206 --> 01:42:16,067
Speaker 0: Like you're engaging with these content.

1176
01:42:16,087 --> 01:42:17,468
Speaker 0: You're seeing the things that they're doing.

1177
01:42:17,948 --> 01:42:22,711
Speaker 0: Are they having trouble implementing, I don't know, AI or LLMs?

1178
01:42:23,211 --> 01:42:23,452
Speaker 0: Great.

1179
01:42:23,592 --> 01:42:25,113
Speaker 0: That's the content you just started generating.

1180
01:42:25,753 --> 01:42:31,866
Speaker 0: Build your authority about How do they integrate these tools into their daily process?

1181
01:42:31,906 --> 01:42:32,846
Speaker 0: You should have a blog.

1182
01:42:33,706 --> 01:42:35,807
Speaker 0: You should have a YouTube.

1183
01:42:36,528 --> 01:42:38,609
Speaker 0: You should have something where you're putting content out there.

1184
01:42:38,929 --> 01:42:46,452
Speaker 0: You're getting feedback from them and from community of some sort to where you're building up that, hey, I'm not just the way that says I do that.

1185
01:42:46,512 --> 01:42:47,812
Speaker 0: You can look at my content.

1186
01:42:47,832 --> 01:42:49,033
Speaker 0: You can look at the things I'm doing.

1187
01:42:49,573 --> 01:42:53,355
Speaker 0: You can look at the things that I say I've done and be able to see that very clearly.

1188
01:42:53,935 --> 01:43:02,638
Speaker 0: And also, by doing that, you're practicing how you talk about these and you're practicing, maybe English is your second language, you're getting more comfortable with these things.

1189
01:43:02,698 --> 01:43:15,361
Speaker 0: that when it comes to hiring the past, the SNF test, you are because these people you've been engaging with for a year plus, they've seen your content, they know who you are, they know what you're capable of, that makes getting into these orgs a little bit easier.

1190
01:43:16,001 --> 01:43:16,501
Speaker 1: Absolutely.

1191
01:43:16,501 --> 01:43:18,202
Speaker 1: 100% agreed.

1192
01:43:18,602 --> 01:43:21,623
Speaker 1: Based on my limited knowledge, I think it sounds like you owe all my knowledge about that.

1193
01:43:22,034 --> 01:43:31,903
Speaker 1: So what I would like to ask then is like let's flip this around employers who want to bring in more folks and this can we can.

1194
01:43:31,963 --> 01:43:34,326
Speaker 1: we can definitely start by talking about folks from overseas.

1195
01:43:34,766 --> 01:43:44,876
Speaker 1: if you want talent if you want to be able to tap that talent and you don't want to like go to some consultancy or something in some other country and say give me like 20 devs right go to info sister whatever you like.

1196
01:43:44,916 --> 01:43:52,423
Speaker 1: you want to literally get the best talent from India or from Nigeria just by picking a developer by developer yourself.

1197
01:43:52,783 --> 01:44:05,616
Speaker 1: You're trying to build out your company or you're a hiring manager and you're trying to build a team, you know, like what strategies, what advice would you give to those people so that they can actually find talented people and what should they be looking for?

1198
01:44:05,636 --> 01:44:05,837
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1199
01:44:06,377 --> 01:44:09,699
Speaker 0: I think partnerships are really great, so we work with a lot of hard partners.

1200
01:44:09,719 --> 01:44:10,719
Speaker 0: that was leading at coders.

1201
01:44:11,219 --> 01:44:14,701
Speaker 0: We sent dozens of folks to Amazon through resilient coders.

1202
01:44:14,721 --> 01:44:24,125
Speaker 0: We sent, we have these very strong partnerships with a lot of orgs that need a good solid pipeline of talent, and so partnering with communities is a really good way to do that.

1203
01:44:25,005 --> 01:44:29,909
Speaker 0: If you came to RC it was encoders or you came to 100 devs and you said give me the best of the best.

1204
01:44:30,269 --> 01:44:31,050
Speaker 0: I would talk to you.

1205
01:44:31,070 --> 01:44:37,055
Speaker 0: I'd make sure that your job is doing all the things that it needs to be done to be done equitably and I felt that that was the case.

1206
01:44:37,455 --> 01:44:38,936
Speaker 0: I would give you all the folks.

1207
01:44:39,016 --> 01:44:52,288
Speaker 0: you would have a pipeline that was full for days of highly qualified, incredibly talented talent from wherever you need them to be from or anywhere you'd want to support as well, like we can make that happen.

1208
01:44:52,328 --> 01:44:57,692
Speaker 0: And so I think for folks that are looking for a good pipeline, just working with communities.

1209
01:44:57,753 --> 01:45:00,835
Speaker 0: So I would of course say, working with myself.

1210
01:45:00,935 --> 01:45:12,179
Speaker 0: You, I always think of Paris Black Tech Pipeline does this work really well where they're able to get you a very strong source of talent from anywhere, from entry level to super senior.

1211
01:45:12,859 --> 01:45:23,067
Speaker 0: And so figuring out these different orgs that have a surplus of talented engineering talent could be a great way to build those those funnels for you.

1212
01:45:23,187 --> 01:45:24,768
Speaker 1: Yeah absolutely.

1213
01:45:25,168 --> 01:45:34,416
Speaker 1: and then for organizations that just want to be more representative of the folks in their community let's say like it's not necessarily remote but here in the U.S.

1214
01:45:36,218 --> 01:45:48,890
Speaker 1: Los Angeles for example like there's a tech startup and they're looking for engineers what I guess general tips would you give to employers so that they can be inclusive and make sure that they're bringing on talent.

1215
01:45:49,170 --> 01:45:50,792
Speaker 1: That actually represents the local population.

1216
01:45:50,812 --> 01:45:54,616
Speaker 1: Instead of just bringing in a bunch of Stanford grads, there's a little like that, right?

1217
01:45:54,956 --> 01:45:58,981
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think it takes champions within a company that actually care about these things.

1218
01:45:59,421 --> 01:46:03,644
Speaker 0: Of course, you can read like the McKinsey reports and more diverse work for us, equals better outcomes, right?

1219
01:46:03,664 --> 01:46:16,212
Speaker 0: So a lot of companies know these things to be true, but it takes someone on the inside that cares about building an equitable workforce for this to actually happen, especially when things like DI and these initiatives are being contested in the courts.

1220
01:46:16,633 --> 01:46:23,058
Speaker 0: A lot of companies are becoming a little bit more shy around being tentosed down, right?

1221
01:46:23,478 --> 01:46:27,141
Speaker 0: And so I think if this is the case, it really doesn't come from top down.

1222
01:46:27,202 --> 01:46:31,286
Speaker 0: It comes from individuals looking around and saying, you know what?

1223
01:46:31,686 --> 01:46:38,853
Speaker 0: I live in a community that is 25% black and brown, but only 1% of our workforce is of color.

1224
01:46:39,113 --> 01:46:40,735
Speaker 0: There's something fundamentally wrong here.

1225
01:46:40,795 --> 01:46:49,360
Speaker 0: When we looked in Boston where I spent most of my career We had the second largest tech economy but double-digit unemployment rates in our communities of colors.

1226
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:51,060
Speaker 0: There's a fundamental mismatch.

1227
01:46:51,480 --> 01:47:04,805
Speaker 0: And so we had a group of individuals that realized that this is just woefully inequitable and they would go to town, they would go to fight the fight every single day to bring one person along, then to bring two along.

1228
01:47:04,865 --> 01:47:07,365
Speaker 0: And the thing is It can compound.

1229
01:47:08,166 --> 01:47:13,388
Speaker 0: Once you have folks in these positions of power, you can turn around and help lift up more along with you.

1230
01:47:13,488 --> 01:47:22,351
Speaker 0: So I don't think it needs to be like a company, why I think, I think, anyways, listening to this call, has this ability to fight for what they know is right, to turn around and say, you know what?

1231
01:47:22,711 --> 01:47:33,896
Speaker 0: I want to make an equitable pathway in my company, and I'm going to work really, really hard for the next open rule, for to be someone that deserves to be here, but might not have the opportunity.

1232
01:47:34,727 --> 01:47:37,409
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that's a huge part of 100 devs.

1233
01:47:37,429 --> 01:47:39,631
Speaker 1: like as far as I can tell from like.

1234
01:47:39,671 --> 01:47:42,133
Speaker 1: listening to a lot of your episodes and stuff.

1235
01:47:42,153 --> 01:48:07,408
Speaker 1: like instead of asking people to like necessarily donate to 100 devs or like you tell them send the elevator back down is something you said a few times like try for every one of the 100 devs cohort members the learners they should try to find somebody else who's an alum and bring them on to their company so that they can kind of uh essentially

1236
01:48:07,868 --> 01:48:08,109
Speaker 0: be

1237
01:48:09,009 --> 01:48:11,849
Speaker 1: increasing the number of alumnus within these organizations.

1238
01:48:11,929 --> 01:48:13,350
Speaker 0: and they're free software community.

1239
01:48:13,370 --> 01:48:16,450
Speaker 0: we have a word grottis right it's not it's not free.

1240
01:48:16,651 --> 01:48:23,673
Speaker 0: it's grottis meaning that there's like no cost like there's no like monetary cost and so 100 devs is grotesque.

1241
01:48:23,693 --> 01:48:24,794
Speaker 0: I mean, there's no money.

1242
01:48:25,094 --> 01:48:26,315
Speaker 0: Nobody should ever come out of your pocket.

1243
01:48:26,355 --> 01:48:29,157
Speaker 0: I never want to see a dollar come out of your pocket for anything.

1244
01:48:29,898 --> 01:48:31,259
Speaker 0: There's no way that you can give us that dollar.

1245
01:48:31,279 --> 01:48:31,840
Speaker 0: we don't want it.

1246
01:48:32,360 --> 01:48:33,061
Speaker 0: But it's not free.

1247
01:48:33,421 --> 01:49:00,838
Speaker 0: And the reason why it's not free is because we expect that when you get the job that you turn around and help three more get into the same position that you have, whether it's helping answer questions, whether it is literally helping people apply and get into the pipeline for your company, the expectation is that This community has invested thousands of hours into your success and the thing that we ask is that you turn around and give a little bit of that time back.

1248
01:49:01,298 --> 01:49:19,322
Speaker 0: And that the reason why 100 does have been so successful is that we have folks that have made it to the upper echelon that are now senior developers at the best tech companies in the world that are still giving up their time every single day on our discord and our huddles to make sure that the next folks are successful.

1249
01:49:21,468 --> 01:49:28,631
Speaker 1: That is a beautiful note to end on just the virtue of this organization that you birth into the world.

1250
01:49:29,592 --> 01:49:31,012
Speaker 1: But let's not end quite yet.

1251
01:49:31,032 --> 01:49:33,173
Speaker 1: Because I want to ask what are the future initiatives?

1252
01:49:33,694 --> 01:49:40,036
Speaker 1: What does the next, what does 2024, the rest of 2024, maybe even 2025, 2025, 2025?

1253
01:49:40,036 --> 01:49:44,118
Speaker 1: Three-cooking we think literally a decade out like working on this computer science degree program.

1254
01:49:44,418 --> 01:49:47,840
Speaker 1: that will take another six years to complete all the coursework for plus and another.

1255
01:49:48,380 --> 01:50:03,090
Speaker 1: five years together, the loans, two-nil data plus probably another five years to have the data approved by a creditors, so we can get the degree program accredited, free computer science, bachelor's degree, free, and mathematics, a associate degree.

1256
01:50:03,190 --> 01:50:09,935
Speaker 0: I was tweeting up a store, I was telling everybody in their mouth, I was running and showing my wife like, look, this is the future.

1257
01:50:10,135 --> 01:50:17,239
Speaker 0: This is the thing that we need the most in the world right now, and so super happy that that's on your vision.

1258
01:50:18,540 --> 01:50:19,782
Speaker 1: education wants to be free.

1259
01:50:20,142 --> 01:50:21,323
Speaker 0: yeah exactly like this.

1260
01:50:21,403 --> 01:50:21,964
Speaker 0: is it right?

1261
01:50:22,004 --> 01:50:23,185
Speaker 0: like doing the work like in?

1262
01:50:23,205 --> 01:50:37,459
Speaker 0: like we said earlier I think free co-camp is amazing at identifying the real gaps like the things that people really need to be successful and filling them and having a community that's willing to step up and do that work to fill those gaps.

1263
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:39,060
Speaker 0: so it's something that.

1264
01:50:40,221 --> 01:50:50,485
Speaker 0: It's the reason why it's the best donation I make every single week, it's the reason why I always send folks to free poker because I know that they're in safe hands to get the things they need done.

1265
01:50:51,866 --> 01:50:53,607
Speaker 0: Free is it free for everyone, right?

1266
01:50:53,627 --> 01:51:01,390
Speaker 0: In terms of time and commitment, a lot of folks that would be extremely successful in a hundred doubts, right?

1267
01:51:01,410 --> 01:51:08,149
Speaker 0: The cliche line is that like, skill and talent is distributed.

1268
01:51:08,730 --> 01:51:10,251
Speaker 0: Opportunity is not, right?

1269
01:51:10,291 --> 01:51:18,916
Speaker 0: And so we have a lot of folks that are extremely talented that that could be phenomenal software engineers, but don't have the opportunity or the privilege of time.

1270
01:51:19,536 --> 01:51:20,617
Speaker 0: They need to take that time.

1271
01:51:20,657 --> 01:51:23,399
Speaker 0: they would be spending learning, driving for Uber.

1272
01:51:23,979 --> 01:51:24,920
Speaker 0: doing that word ash.

1273
01:51:25,340 --> 01:51:28,503
Speaker 0: They need to take that time to put food on the table for their family.

1274
01:51:29,143 --> 01:51:38,731
Speaker 0: And when we pulled our collective, we saw that folks really only need it around $200 a week to make this a viable pathway.

1275
01:51:39,211 --> 01:51:46,858
Speaker 0: So our huge big goal is to build out an agency model where real companies come.

1276
01:51:47,518 --> 01:51:50,560
Speaker 0: They have work that they need for us to accomplish.

1277
01:51:50,881 --> 01:51:55,044
Speaker 0: We have super-season professional engineers that lead those projects.

1278
01:51:55,524 --> 01:51:59,367
Speaker 0: And then we break those projects down into individual issues or tasks.

1279
01:51:59,727 --> 01:52:07,352
Speaker 0: So that as you're learning, you're also maybe picking up some of these tasks in a real code base, like your skills become intensely practical.

1280
01:52:07,793 --> 01:52:21,243
Speaker 0: And by the time you graduate or leave 100 devs, you've built real projects for real companies with production level code, And all the money that comes into agency goes directly into those issues so that you're also getting a little bit of money coming in as you're working through it.

1281
01:52:21,684 --> 01:52:29,810
Speaker 0: And we think that might make our program more equitable for folks that just don't have that last little bit of privilege of free time.

1282
01:52:29,870 --> 01:52:36,491
Speaker 0: And so Like I said, we talked earlier, we're a group of people that run ahead first and they're really big audacious goals.

1283
01:52:36,531 --> 01:52:37,091
Speaker 0: Sometimes it works.

1284
01:52:37,111 --> 01:52:37,791
Speaker 0: Sometimes it doesn't.

1285
01:52:37,811 --> 01:52:37,911
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1286
01:52:37,931 --> 01:52:39,291
Speaker 0: We're going to have a lot of mistakes.

1287
01:52:39,351 --> 01:52:41,832
Speaker 0: A lot of things are going to go wrong, but we're going to figure it out.

1288
01:52:42,232 --> 01:52:52,135
Speaker 0: And our goal is that when we launched our next cohort, we also have this agency model in place as well, so that you're not only learning, but getting this practical paid experience as well.

1289
01:52:52,455 --> 01:52:53,316
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's so cool.

1290
01:52:53,376 --> 01:52:58,338
Speaker 1: I mean, that's like we're all about taking away excuses from people.

1291
01:52:58,378 --> 01:53:09,725
Speaker 1: And it's in like to be fair, like a lot of excuses like if you have young kids or if you're taking care of your folks, if you're working like three jobs to be able to pay exorbitant rent in your city, you know, like those are very

1292
01:53:10,754 --> 01:53:11,194
Speaker 0: reasonable

1293
01:53:11,254 --> 01:53:23,904
Speaker 1: reasons for not being able to spend a lot of time coding, but if there are things you can do to remove some of those barriers to make it easier for people to commit to, and are already archuous process of learning to code, right?

1294
01:53:24,384 --> 01:53:30,869
Speaker 1: And nobody, anybody who says learning to code is easy is trying to tell you something like, it is hard as heck.

1295
01:53:31,750 --> 01:53:32,811
Speaker 1: It's getting easier every year.

1296
01:53:33,072 --> 01:53:35,875
Speaker 1: We're not dealing with punch cards, you know, we're in higher levels of abstraction.

1297
01:53:36,235 --> 01:53:38,157
Speaker 1: It's becoming easier, but it's not a Star Trek easy.

1298
01:53:38,177 --> 01:53:39,259
Speaker 1: You just talked to the computer, right?

1299
01:53:39,899 --> 01:53:43,343
Speaker 1: Uh, eventually won't be, but maybe in the 24th century.

1300
01:53:45,406 --> 01:53:46,267
Speaker 1: The more immediate problem.

1301
01:53:47,027 --> 01:53:49,808
Speaker 1: helping people free up their time so they can actually learn.

1302
01:53:50,088 --> 01:53:53,028
Speaker 1: I just want to commend you on this program.

1303
01:53:53,128 --> 01:54:08,151
Speaker 1: I love the idea of getting people out there doing a real-world work, getting compensation through some sort of program where they can just, I mean, even $200 a week, it sounds like it's going to be a huge lifeline for a lot of these folks and free up a lot of time and energy.

1304
01:54:09,692 --> 01:54:14,313
Speaker 1: This is extremely exciting and I would be very excited to have you back on in the future.

1305
01:54:16,613 --> 01:54:21,881
Speaker 1: see what you learned from running this this new uh... experiment this bold endeavor.

1306
01:54:22,762 --> 01:54:25,045
Speaker 0: all i noticed awesome and well.

1307
01:54:25,226 --> 01:54:32,336
Speaker 1: it's been such a joy learning so much from you not just from this conversation but just you know falling on twitter.

1308
01:54:33,217 --> 01:54:35,878
Speaker 1: I'm going to add links to a lot of stuff that we talked about.

1309
01:54:36,419 --> 01:54:38,940
Speaker 1: In here, I'm going to, of course, link to 100 devs.

1310
01:54:39,480 --> 01:54:43,963
Speaker 1: And I just encourage people to learn more about the work of Leon.

1311
01:54:44,383 --> 01:54:47,845
Speaker 1: Learn more about 100 devs, resulting in coders.

1312
01:54:48,485 --> 01:54:54,348
Speaker 1: These organizations that are like, resulting in coders is a charity, like Free Code Camp, 501c3.

1313
01:54:55,088 --> 01:55:01,012
Speaker 1: And there are lots of charities out there that are doing important work.

1314
01:55:01,992 --> 01:55:06,235
Speaker 1: I'm going to try to encourage people to do what we've done, the two of us.

1315
01:55:06,776 --> 01:55:09,598
Speaker 1: And yes, you can create a startup and make a lot of money.

1316
01:55:10,118 --> 01:55:17,443
Speaker 1: And life changing money, especially if you've got family that are back in a home country that needs support, right?

1317
01:55:17,884 --> 01:55:24,168
Speaker 1: Or if you have any number of different things, I will never give people a hard time about just wanting to make a whole lot of money.

1318
01:55:25,249 --> 01:55:38,646
Speaker 1: If you have the means, if you are somebody who's mid-career and wants to do something in the charity space, I hope that the accomplishments of Leon and, and modestly, oh, oh, a free co-camp, like, did I?

1319
01:55:38,926 --> 01:55:41,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's no modded, there needs to be had there.

1320
01:55:42,170 --> 01:55:50,435
Speaker 1: Yes, I hope some of this will inspire you to also consider doing work in the public space, right, as a tax-exhib public charity.

1321
01:55:51,195 --> 01:55:57,239
Speaker 1: And again, I just want to commend the work you're doing, Leon, and I hope everybody has learned a great deal.

1322
01:55:58,416 --> 01:55:59,016
Speaker 0: I appreciate it.

1323
01:55:59,036 --> 01:55:59,717
Speaker 0: Thank you so much.

1324
01:55:59,797 --> 01:56:02,198
Speaker 0: Like I said, this is a dream come true.

1325
01:56:02,578 --> 01:56:09,482
Speaker 0: You've inspired me so much throughout my entire journey into this and I know you do the same for so many other folks each and every single day.

1326
01:56:09,522 --> 01:56:14,105
Speaker 0: So thank you for the work that you do in our communities, right, that help push this stuff through.

1327
01:56:14,445 --> 01:56:17,807
Speaker 1: Yeah, and to everybody in the Hunter Devs community is watching this.

1328
01:56:19,128 --> 01:56:19,568
Speaker 1: Hang in there.

1329
01:56:19,788 --> 01:56:21,449
Speaker 1: Keep it up, man.

1330
01:56:21,509 --> 01:56:28,538
Speaker 1: And women, you all are doing a long, grueling process, but you're helping one another.

1331
01:56:28,859 --> 01:56:31,124
Speaker 1: And you know, you're making friends along the way.

1332
01:56:31,725 --> 01:56:35,835
Speaker 1: So with that, I just wanted to thank everybody for tuning in.

1333
01:56:36,055 --> 01:56:38,260
Speaker 1: Until next week, happy coding.
