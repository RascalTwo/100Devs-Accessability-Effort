00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:07,758
Quincy Larson: do do do.

2
00:00:36,044 --> 00:00:38,626
Quincy Larson: Welcome back to the FreeCodeCamp podcast.

3
00:00:38,766 --> 00:00:41,869
Quincy Larson: I'm Quincy Larson, teacher and founder of FreeCodeCamp.org.

4
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:47,854
Quincy Larson: Each week, we're bringing you insight from developers, founders, and ambitious people that are getting into tech.

5
00:00:48,094 --> 00:00:57,602
Quincy Larson: Today, we're talking with Leon Noel, who, I don't know if you've heard of 100Devs, but it's amazing and it's a huge source of inspiration for me personally.

6
00:00:58,003 --> 00:01:02,747
Quincy Larson: He is the founder of 100Devs and he is head of engineering at Resilient Coders.

7
00:01:03,956 --> 00:01:08,279
Quincy Larson: Leon, joining us from sunny Los Angeles.

8
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:09,679
Quincy Larson: How's everything going with you?

9
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:10,720
Quincy Larson: It's a little early.

10
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,821
Leon Noel: We'll see if the sun comes out.

11
00:01:11,901 --> 00:01:12,941
Leon Noel: Things are going well.

12
00:01:14,022 --> 00:01:16,403
Leon Noel: This is a surreal experience.

13
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:17,564
Leon Noel: Thank you so much for having me.

14
00:01:18,064 --> 00:01:20,486
Leon Noel: And we'll get weird with it real quick.

15
00:01:22,087 --> 00:01:25,869
Leon Noel: I always joke that my wife knows how serious I am.

16
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:33,115
Leon Noel: if your face is like the background of my like screens or I've had a picture of you on my desk for a little while.

17
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:37,639
Leon Noel: So she knows if it's go time or not based off of like she's seeing you.

18
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,481
Leon Noel: So it's an honor.

19
00:01:39,501 --> 00:01:40,422
Leon Noel: It's a huge privilege.

20
00:01:40,482 --> 00:01:42,563
Leon Noel: Like this is a dream come true for me.

21
00:01:42,864 --> 00:01:48,749
Leon Noel: You're a huge hero of mine and I've done so much to help so many folks and you're who I want to be when I grow up.

22
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:49,890
Leon Noel: So I really appreciate it.

23
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:50,951
Leon Noel: Thanks for having me on.

24
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:54,392
Quincy Larson: Yeah, well, I just want to say that it's like very kind.

25
00:01:54,932 --> 00:02:04,061
Quincy Larson: And I want to say that that goes both ways, like often when I'm feeling like a little bit low energy and I was, you know, I don't know if I can get a lot done today.

26
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:10,228
Quincy Larson: Maybe I'll just, you know, go and answer a bunch of emails and not do like curriculum design or.

27
00:02:10,808 --> 00:02:12,790
Quincy Larson: You know, I'll go into like the.

28
00:02:13,812 --> 00:02:15,393
Quincy Larson: I'm like, what would Leon do?

29
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:16,815
Quincy Larson: He would dive in headfirst.

30
00:02:16,855 --> 00:02:22,121
Quincy Larson: He would have so much energy overflowing and he would just go in there and get things done.

31
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:25,385
Quincy Larson: And so, yeah, like I do think about you a lot.

32
00:02:25,765 --> 00:02:36,693
Quincy Larson: when I'm just feeling low energy, because I've watched your streams, and I've seen the amount of energy, both literal energy, like bursting forth, and the positive energy that you bring to the community.

33
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:39,014
Quincy Larson: So thank you for that.

34
00:02:39,094 --> 00:02:46,860
Quincy Larson: And I'll make a little meme of Wolverine holding the picture frame, and then Leon holding the picture of me.

35
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:52,744
Quincy Larson: I won't really do that, but when you said that, that just felt hot to me in my mind, because I love X-Men.

36
00:02:53,124 --> 00:02:55,266
Leon Noel: So, um, Leon.

37
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:57,227
Leon Noel: Did you see the new announcement?

38
00:02:57,227 --> 00:02:58,348
Leon Noel: 97?

39
00:02:58,348 --> 00:02:58,448
Leon Noel: No.

40
00:02:59,489 --> 00:02:59,969
Leon Noel: What's happening?

41
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:02,491
Leon Noel: They're redoing the old school cartoon.

42
00:03:03,272 --> 00:03:03,912
Leon Noel: Oh my goodness.

43
00:03:03,992 --> 00:03:07,515
Leon Noel: Like post-Professor X. Like the original 90s Saturday morning.

44
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:09,456
Leon Noel: All right.

45
00:03:09,596 --> 00:03:09,916
Leon Noel: No more.

46
00:03:09,936 --> 00:03:11,857
Leon Noel: Everybody stop the podcast.

47
00:03:11,877 --> 00:03:12,818
Leon Noel: We're going to watch the trailer.

48
00:03:13,658 --> 00:03:14,299
Leon Noel: It's really good.

49
00:03:14,339 --> 00:03:15,039
Leon Noel: It looks really good.

50
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:17,180
Quincy Larson: I will put a link to the trailer in the show notes.

51
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:23,363
Leon Noel: I have a little bit of tears in my eyes when there's a specific catchphrase that is said, but yeah.

52
00:03:23,423 --> 00:03:25,224
Quincy Larson: OK, I'm going to link to that.

53
00:03:25,564 --> 00:03:40,932
Quincy Larson: Be sure to watch that immediately after you finish watching or listening to this podcast interview, because we've got a ton of advice that's practical and not just, you know, something that you can do to escape from your day to day experience, but to build up your day to day experience and accomplish your goals.

54
00:03:41,332 --> 00:03:59,784
Quincy Larson: So Leon, before we dive into 100 devs and resilient coders and all the work you've done, I like to always start these interviews with more autobiographical stuff just so people can have context into like who you are, your lived experience, where you're coming from and where you're heading and things like that.

55
00:04:00,264 --> 00:04:07,329
Quincy Larson: So maybe you could take us back to where you grew up and like what your earliest ambitions were as a kid.

56
00:04:08,191 --> 00:04:13,334
Leon Noel: Yeah, so I grew up in Philly, definitely 100% a product of Philly.

57
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:18,476
Leon Noel: I was always kind of a very kind of tinkering, wanting to build type of kid.

58
00:04:19,297 --> 00:04:27,401
Leon Noel: I grew up with a huge household, a big family, all in one row home in South Philly, which was amazing.

59
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:40,971
Leon Noel: And I was blessed to have amazing libraries where I had access to computers and could Tinker and build and I was really blessed even have a lot of even just computer science education.

60
00:04:41,092 --> 00:04:49,300
Leon Noel: early throughout my life I had a Q basic class in middle school where I would get a sailboat to go from one side of the screen to the other.

61
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:55,123
Leon Noel: I thought I had magical powers and yeah, I I was very lucky to have the skill so so early.

62
00:04:55,143 --> 00:05:05,106
Leon Noel: We also in Philly have magnet schools or which are kind of like exam schools that you test into and so I went to engineering and science where I had two years of c++.

63
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,948
Leon Noel: in high school and this is like 20 years ago.

64
00:05:09,488 --> 00:05:25,835
Leon Noel: and so yeah I just I'm very lucky to have grown up in an environment that supported my passions and interests even when I didn't have access to those technologies or knowledge that there was a way for me to get access to it.

65
00:05:25,895 --> 00:05:27,616
Leon Noel: so very very thankful for that.

66
00:05:28,357 --> 00:05:28,897
Quincy Larson: That's awesome.

67
00:05:28,957 --> 00:05:37,502
Quincy Larson: yeah that's it sounds like a really kind of like idyllic upbringing in the sense that like you've got Access to.

68
00:05:37,762 --> 00:05:38,442
Quincy Larson: what about teachers?

69
00:05:38,623 --> 00:05:41,865
Quincy Larson: Did you have any teachers as a kid who like really propelled you forward?

70
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:50,512
Quincy Larson: I always talked very passionately about my my 7th grade teacher or 8th grade teacher, science teacher, Mr.

71
00:05:50,552 --> 00:05:53,434
Quincy Larson: Krieger, whom I've failed to track down.

72
00:05:53,474 --> 00:05:54,735
Quincy Larson: If you know of Mr.

73
00:05:54,775 --> 00:06:04,683
Quincy Larson: Krieger, who taught at, you know, Hoover Middle School, which was is like now destroyed, bulldozed school in Oklahoma City.

74
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,284
Quincy Larson: If anybody's heard of that person, let me know.

75
00:06:07,364 --> 00:06:10,926
Quincy Larson: but did you have anybody like a mr Krieger in your life who?

76
00:06:11,547 --> 00:06:15,749
Quincy Larson: Was eccentric and interesting but kept giving you like interesting books about space and stuff like that?

77
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:18,310
Leon Noel: Yeah, so I've been lucky to have a few.

78
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:35,183
Leon Noel: so miss Francine was my fifth grade teacher that when I was done my coursework would Not let me just sit there twiddling my thumbs but always had like puzzles and things to build and tinker with in the background and I Likewise, I've tried to find them.

79
00:06:35,203 --> 00:06:51,278
Leon Noel: I haven't been able to find them, but they really kind of showed me that I could be in control of my learning, that it wasn't a one-way depositing of knowledge, that I could have some sort of control or command over the things I was doing with my free time.

80
00:06:51,358 --> 00:06:55,639
Leon Noel: that would enable me to think creatively and to do things I wanted to do.

81
00:06:55,659 --> 00:07:09,042
Leon Noel: I had a lot of wonderful folks throughout high school that really helped guide me, that pushed me, that maybe saw something inside of me that I didn't see inside of myself and would try and pull that out.

82
00:07:09,722 --> 00:07:12,584
Leon Noel: my, we're talking about like code education, shout out Mr.

83
00:07:12,624 --> 00:07:16,826
Leon Noel: Shipper, would push me to learn my C++.

84
00:07:17,147 --> 00:07:28,233
Leon Noel: and we had the old school like matrix printers where you'd print out your code on them and I would look through it and take it to them and try to point out bugs or errors.

85
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:34,259
Leon Noel: and You talk about folks in your life that do the small things right, and Mr.

86
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:39,463
Leon Noel: Shipper, every birthday, for years and years, would just send me a happy birthday message.

87
00:07:39,503 --> 00:07:44,388
Leon Noel: So talking about folks that just support you long-term, that was there.

88
00:07:44,608 --> 00:07:47,191
Leon Noel: And then in university, it was Dr.

89
00:07:47,211 --> 00:08:12,846
Leon Noel: Bupieskus, the person that showed me that I could be what I wanted to be and supported my ability to learn, supported what I wanted to do, made sure that I had funding over the summer to live, made sure that I got to do the research I wanted to do, and ultimately gave me the skills that I thought I needed to be the person I wanted to be in life.

90
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:18,408
Leon Noel: And so, yeah, definitely the product of amazing teachers throughout my entire life.

91
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:25,752
Leon Noel: Definitely something that I try to think of with Rizzle Encoders and 100Devs, like.

92
00:08:26,392 --> 00:08:34,196
Leon Noel: what was it about those folks that inspired me to do more, to learn, to feel comfortable, and try and bring that into the classroom as well.

93
00:08:34,756 --> 00:08:34,976
Quincy Larson: Yeah.

94
00:08:35,256 --> 00:08:35,437
Quincy Larson: Yeah.

95
00:08:35,876 --> 00:08:44,006
Quincy Larson: It's so cool to talk with another teacher because obviously you're a software engineer, but you're also a teacher to many, many people, not necessarily in the conventional way.

96
00:08:45,207 --> 00:08:46,889
Quincy Larson: Maybe in the conventional way, too.

97
00:08:46,969 --> 00:08:56,238
Quincy Larson: Maybe you actually give lectures occasionally in person, but like through 100 devs, you're essentially like the classroom teacher that people need, you know, like.

98
00:08:56,478 --> 00:08:56,759
Quincy Larson: Yeah.

99
00:08:57,119 --> 00:09:09,604
Quincy Larson: You know, the VAT signals up in the air, the 100 dev signal, and you're answering that call and you're helping people with the not just practical challenges of learning to code, but the motivational challenges as well.

100
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:12,665
Quincy Larson: And that's a huge thing I take away from your stream.

101
00:09:13,365 --> 00:09:22,109
Quincy Larson: It sounds like you went on to do really well academically, I presume, because you went to one of the best universities in the world.

102
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:26,831
Quincy Larson: Maybe you could talk a little bit about what that process was like.

103
00:09:26,891 --> 00:09:33,374
Quincy Larson: What was it like getting into a relatively elite school?

104
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:35,715
Quincy Larson: How long did you have that plan?

105
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,876
Quincy Larson: At what age did you snap to awareness?

106
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:41,919
Quincy Larson: I always like to tell people, I kind of snapped to awareness much later in life.

107
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,142
Quincy Larson: I was maybe like 20, 21.

108
00:09:45,142 --> 00:09:53,689
Quincy Larson: And that's when I got really into journalism and studying foreign languages and stuff, themes that would kind of run throughout the rest of my life, living abroad.

109
00:09:53,769 --> 00:10:01,636
Quincy Larson: And ultimately, much later, I had kind of a second thing where I learned like technology is really, really gosh darn useful.

110
00:10:02,316 --> 00:10:05,499
Quincy Larson: And that's when I learned to code and automated stuff for my school and stuff.

111
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,422
Quincy Larson: But did you have an early kind of awakening at some point?

112
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:19,329
Quincy Larson: Do you remember a distinct period of your life where you're like, hey, I can do a lot more than other people around me are doing, my peers?

113
00:10:19,409 --> 00:10:20,950
Quincy Larson: Was there such an awakening for you?

114
00:10:24,453 --> 00:10:27,417
Leon Noel: I wanted to be comfortable.

115
00:10:27,437 --> 00:10:30,841
Leon Noel: I wanted to have a good life.

116
00:10:31,301 --> 00:10:40,452
Leon Noel: And I think early on, especially as like a kid of color, you're kind of taught this very, it's just like doctor, lawyer, dentist, it comes up over and over and over again.

117
00:10:40,472 --> 00:10:54,156
Leon Noel: And it comes from maybe our families and the folks in our community not knowing kind of all of the opportunities that are available, but those are the safe pathways that Dr.

118
00:10:54,216 --> 00:10:54,857
Leon Noel: Lurie Dent is.

119
00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:56,959
Leon Noel: And so yeah, for 100 years.

120
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,541
Leon Noel: Yeah, really?

121
00:10:58,582 --> 00:10:58,802
Leon Noel: Yeah.

122
00:10:58,842 --> 00:10:59,683
Leon Noel: So it's proven.

123
00:10:59,703 --> 00:11:05,107
Leon Noel: So that's kind of the path that I got put on as someone who was successful pretty early academically.

124
00:11:05,127 --> 00:11:06,967
Leon Noel: I did well in elementary school.

125
00:11:07,047 --> 00:11:12,389
Leon Noel: I used to have to go from my school to another school every week to do other programs.

126
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:20,233
Leon Noel: And I saw how hard my grandparents had to work.

127
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:26,015
Leon Noel: I saw how hard my grandfather worked, specifically, in a boiler room every day.

128
00:11:26,055 --> 00:11:26,695
Leon Noel: It was hot.

129
00:11:26,775 --> 00:11:27,836
Leon Noel: They were pulling valves.

130
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:44,393
Leon Noel: I saw what hardware could do, and I wanted to do something that would enable me to have a good life, but maybe not be so sweaty, right?

131
00:11:44,893 --> 00:11:48,936
Leon Noel: And so that idea led me to look into Dr.

132
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:49,817
Leon Noel: Larry Dentist, Dr.

133
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:50,558
Leon Noel: Larry Dentist.

134
00:11:52,931 --> 00:11:59,273
Leon Noel: As I went through middle school, I was very focused on getting into one of our magnet schools.

135
00:11:59,673 --> 00:12:04,775
Leon Noel: So Philly has some amazing schools that you kind of test in, and it's more of like a lottery now, too, as well.

136
00:12:05,335 --> 00:12:06,775
Leon Noel: And I went to engineering and science.

137
00:12:07,095 --> 00:12:18,558
Leon Noel: And engineering and science was geared around getting folks into engineering and science, and had tracks that you could follow, and a really good placement rate into universities.

138
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:27,023
Leon Noel: For a while, my sophomore, junior, senior year, pretty much every lunch period was spent with Ms.

139
00:12:27,063 --> 00:12:37,890
Leon Noel: Brown, who's my guidance counselor, and would make sure that I was getting access to everything I needed to do well academically and to get into really good schools.

140
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:42,934
Leon Noel: And coming from a low-income family, it's really expensive, so Ms.

141
00:12:42,974 --> 00:12:59,845
Leon Noel: Brown would make sure that I had vouchers for everything that I could take the SAT for free, that I could apply to schools for free, that would get me into all the best summer programs that could help me academically.

142
00:13:00,305 --> 00:13:08,510
Leon Noel: I did Upward Bound for a while, made sure I had access to things that I didn't, like calculators and things like that.

143
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:17,014
Leon Noel: And so my school, I owe a lot to in terms of getting me prepared for eventually what I would go to is Yale.

144
00:13:17,474 --> 00:13:36,723
Leon Noel: And so for me, I think I've just been really blessed to be the product of a school system that if I wanted it, if I wanted to work hard, if I wanted to put in the hours and I played three sports, I did every club imaginable, but I had really amazing people that guided me through that process.

145
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:49,754
Leon Noel: And then I was able to, make it from from ENS into Yale and then went into hard sciences and was on this track to be a doctor, right?

146
00:13:50,354 --> 00:13:50,615
Leon Noel: Dr.

147
00:13:50,635 --> 00:13:52,016
Leon Noel: Laura Dentis, I chose doctor.

148
00:13:52,036 --> 00:14:02,502
Leon Noel: My mom was an LPN and I got to grow up in doctor's offices and see and talk to folks.

149
00:14:02,602 --> 00:14:04,623
Leon Noel: And that was kind of the path I was on.

150
00:14:04,683 --> 00:14:19,389
Leon Noel: And it's kind of funny because I was doing computer science, I was in an engineering high school, and I just didn't allow myself to see that as my path or my career, even though that's where eventually I should have been and eventually did make it to.

151
00:14:19,789 --> 00:14:22,990
Leon Noel: And so that's kind of the long winding path into, yeah.

152
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:27,475
Quincy Larson: Awesome, and LPN is Licensed Practitioner, Licensed Practicing Nurse?

153
00:14:27,956 --> 00:14:30,339
Leon Noel: Yeah, it's like a vocational nurse basically.

154
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:38,649
Leon Noel: So instead of doing, now I guess the track is like your bachelors and you get like your RN, this was a vocational pathway to being a nurse.

155
00:14:39,591 --> 00:14:39,771
Quincy Larson: Yeah.

156
00:14:39,951 --> 00:14:40,111
Quincy Larson: Yeah.

157
00:14:40,131 --> 00:14:41,232
Quincy Larson: I just want to make sure I got that right.

158
00:14:41,272 --> 00:14:51,015
Quincy Larson: And I have like this policy that like, no matter how common the acronym is, I always try to spell it out for especially for our listeners abroad, non native English speaker listeners as well.

159
00:14:51,215 --> 00:14:53,736
Quincy Larson: Um, uh, so, okay.

160
00:14:53,756 --> 00:14:56,396
Quincy Larson: So just recapitulate some of that.

161
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:57,617
Quincy Larson: I've been taking detailed notices.

162
00:14:57,657 --> 00:15:02,398
Quincy Larson: You talk just because this is so interesting and I'll, um, I'll email these to myself.

163
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:05,599
Quincy Larson: These are not for public consumption, but it's basically the contents of this conversation.

164
00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:06,260
Quincy Larson: It's public now.

165
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:11,541
Quincy Larson: So, um, It sounds like you didn't.

166
00:15:11,641 --> 00:15:12,441
Quincy Larson: it just didn't even click.

167
00:15:12,461 --> 00:15:33,555
Quincy Larson: It didn't even really occur to you that software engineering was a field you could go into because like so many people coming from underprivileged backgrounds, so many, you know, second generation immigrants or even first generation immigrants, so many people growing up who are kind of still in the shadow of inequality, like racial inequality that's systemic.

168
00:15:33,675 --> 00:15:44,524
Quincy Larson: That is the reason one of the reasons why, you know, wealth among black families is like Something like 1 10th of like white families that have been in the US the same duration of time.

169
00:15:44,564 --> 00:15:50,969
Quincy Larson: I mean, it's like ridiculous, but because of these circumstances You were pushed to do.

170
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:51,310
Quincy Larson: Dr.

171
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:56,834
Quincy Larson: Lawyer dentist and again like most of my doctors Dentists

172
00:15:57,395 --> 00:15:57,555
Leon Noel: that

173
00:15:57,655 --> 00:16:23,026
Quincy Larson: I haven't had any lawyers thankfully like over the years have been people that who came from a different country, like their parents came from a different country, or that in many cases as doctors, they literally came from like India, past the USMLE, which is this incredibly stringent test, essentially like recertified as doctors, a very lengthy, costly process, just so they could practice in the US because the US is like, you know, a great place to live.

174
00:16:23,466 --> 00:16:24,888
Quincy Larson: And it's a great place to work as a physician.

175
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:27,372
Quincy Larson: Generally, I guess I shouldn't speak for all that.

176
00:16:27,432 --> 00:16:33,803
Quincy Larson: there may be some positions in the audience who take issue with that because of regulatory issues and all this other stuff.

177
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:42,407
Quincy Larson: My point is, you were so focused on that because that is what success sounded like.

178
00:16:42,927 --> 00:16:50,472
Quincy Larson: That was like the family's perception of success and software engineering is like a relatively new thing that is not well understood.

179
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:54,775
Quincy Larson: And it's not a surprise because software engineering has only existed a few decades, right?

180
00:16:55,555 --> 00:17:12,515
Quincy Larson: Maybe you could talk about like, what that awakening to software engineering was like and how you went about, okay, I'm going to go much deeper on coding and learning about computer science and math, like all these things that you need to be a successful software engineer.

181
00:17:13,315 --> 00:17:18,178
Quincy Larson: Oh, no, no, I you may take issue with me saying like you need a whole lot of math, for example, or something like that.

182
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:23,961
Quincy Larson: I don't think that's necessarily true for a lot of jobs, but I always tell people like there is no knowledge.

183
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,041
Quincy Larson: that is not like.

184
00:17:25,582 --> 00:17:27,823
Quincy Larson: you should definitely learn math if you have the time.

185
00:17:27,903 --> 00:17:30,725
Quincy Larson: It's probably not the highest priority if you just want to go get a job as a developer.

186
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:33,614
Quincy Larson: Sorry, but my question for you, Leon.

187
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:34,795
Quincy Larson: Mathematics.

188
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:35,195
Quincy Larson: All right.

189
00:17:35,235 --> 00:17:36,055
Quincy Larson: Complete introduction.

190
00:17:36,616 --> 00:17:36,956
Quincy Larson: Right on.

191
00:17:37,076 --> 00:17:37,336
Quincy Larson: OK.

192
00:17:37,376 --> 00:17:39,137
Quincy Larson: So I'm glad to hear that.

193
00:17:39,178 --> 00:17:45,802
Quincy Larson: Like, yeah, because a lot of times I hear like, I think one of the pieces of misinformation that's going around is like, oh, you don't need math to be a developer.

194
00:17:46,242 --> 00:17:47,323
Quincy Larson: Like, I don't know any math.

195
00:17:47,343 --> 00:17:49,164
Quincy Larson: Like, I just took high school math and I'm a developer.

196
00:17:49,565 --> 00:17:55,348
Quincy Larson: And like, That is true to an extent, but there is kind of like a ceiling that you're going to hit in your engineering career.

197
00:17:55,588 --> 00:18:02,311
Quincy Larson: If you don't like at least take some time to learn some mathematics and you can learn mathematics right here on Free Code Camp's YouTube channel.

198
00:18:02,732 --> 00:18:10,256
Quincy Larson: We have courses on pretty much every engineering math topic that you would learn at like an undergraduate engineering program.

199
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:14,358
Quincy Larson: So, you know, it's just investment of time.

200
00:18:14,418 --> 00:18:19,921
Quincy Larson: And that's a big thing we'll talk about in a little bit is like, is it really free in the sense that you have to invest your time and energy?

201
00:18:20,401 --> 00:18:23,463
Quincy Larson: And not everybody has equal time and energy.

202
00:18:23,483 --> 00:18:28,245
Quincy Larson: Some people have all kinds of different circumstances that inform their availability to learn to code.

203
00:18:28,725 --> 00:18:29,986
Quincy Larson: So we'll talk about that in a minute.

204
00:18:30,006 --> 00:18:32,007
Quincy Larson: But like, how did you approach this?

205
00:18:32,147 --> 00:18:33,908
Quincy Larson: And like, maybe how old were you?

206
00:18:34,028 --> 00:18:36,690
Quincy Larson: Were you still in school when you realized that you wanted to do CS?

207
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:42,761
Leon Noel: Yeah, so I was always building.

208
00:18:43,521 --> 00:18:50,705
Leon Noel: So when I started in sixth grade, I learned QBasic and I would go to the libraries and tinker and build.

209
00:18:50,745 --> 00:18:57,308
Leon Noel: When I was in high school, Upward Bound got me a TI-83 Plus calculator, which I still have.

210
00:18:57,348 --> 00:18:58,989
Leon Noel: It's like in my drawer over here somewhere.

211
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:03,192
Leon Noel: And you could write code for that calculator.

212
00:19:03,572 --> 00:19:05,113
Leon Noel: And I remember swapping.

213
00:19:05,153 --> 00:19:08,135
Leon Noel: I felt like it was like old school, you know, like how people used to swap floppies.

214
00:19:08,255 --> 00:19:14,379
Leon Noel: I would swap the games and programs from the calculator and go to the library.

215
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:24,966
Leon Noel: And like, I remember the thing I wanted for one Christmas was like the cable that connected the calculator to the computer so that I could like put my code on it.

216
00:19:25,086 --> 00:19:35,475
Leon Noel: And so I remember very early working on calculator games and other fun stuff that I just wanted to bring into the world or modify and hack on.

217
00:19:35,515 --> 00:19:36,837
Leon Noel: And so that was always really fun.

218
00:19:36,857 --> 00:19:41,822
Leon Noel: And then I had that kind of formal C++ in high school.

219
00:19:41,842 --> 00:19:44,524
Leon Noel: And then when I got to university, it all went out the window.

220
00:19:44,544 --> 00:19:45,946
Leon Noel: I was doing hard biology.

221
00:19:45,966 --> 00:19:49,429
Leon Noel: I was doing eventually biological anthropology.

222
00:19:49,469 --> 00:19:52,032
Leon Noel: I was looking at hormones, testosterone and stuff like that.

223
00:19:52,552 --> 00:19:57,858
Leon Noel: But this entire time I'd always been building, tinkering, I really liked entrepreneurship.

224
00:19:58,178 --> 00:20:02,462
Leon Noel: I was always trying to start ideas, small companies, things like that.

225
00:20:02,562 --> 00:20:13,053
Leon Noel: And I had started one kind of simple project that went pretty viral in New Haven, New York area.

226
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:17,675
Leon Noel: And that kind of really showed me some of the power of these skills that I've been kind of accumulating.

227
00:20:18,215 --> 00:20:28,821
Leon Noel: But the real kind of awakening for me for computer science was every summer I was doing lab work and I had figured out how to like survive.

228
00:20:29,441 --> 00:20:35,864
Leon Noel: When you're low income going into like an Ivy League school, basically they give you a full ride right off the rip.

229
00:20:36,024 --> 00:20:45,729
Leon Noel: And so I had figured out that if I didn't live on campus, they would give me whatever the amount of money was to stay on campus, they would give me.

230
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,611
Leon Noel: And I was able to use that to do stuff.

231
00:20:48,671 --> 00:20:53,254
Leon Noel: I would pay rent and food, but I was happy eating pasta and pasta sauce.

232
00:20:53,274 --> 00:21:00,558
Leon Noel: And so I actually had money to live and do all the things that all my fellow students were doing because I had figured out this way of doing it.

233
00:21:01,639 --> 00:21:06,221
Leon Noel: But I ran out of money one summer, and it was getting pretty dicey pretty quickly.

234
00:21:06,322 --> 00:21:10,003
Leon Noel: I really didn't have any money for food left, literally hungry.

235
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:14,645
Leon Noel: And I realized that I could do things like.

236
00:21:14,805 --> 00:21:16,345
Leon Noel: I was looking up like quick jobs.

237
00:21:16,365 --> 00:21:19,306
Leon Noel: And then I was like, wait a minute, let me, let me see if I can build somebody a website.

238
00:21:19,366 --> 00:21:19,966
Leon Noel: I know how to do it.

239
00:21:19,986 --> 00:21:23,607
Leon Noel: I've been building all these like landing pages and small things with code before.

240
00:21:24,107 --> 00:21:26,368
Leon Noel: So I put on Craigslist, Hey, I'll build you a site.

241
00:21:26,388 --> 00:21:27,528
Leon Noel: I can get it done today.

242
00:21:27,548 --> 00:21:31,950
Leon Noel: And somebody responded and they paid a deposit.

243
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:36,373
Leon Noel: and My life changed from that moment.

244
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:38,595
Leon Noel: I skipped all the way to the grocery store.

245
00:21:38,955 --> 00:21:39,716
Leon Noel: I bought my pasta.

246
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,517
Leon Noel: I bought my pasta sauce for the month.

247
00:21:42,138 --> 00:21:43,159
Leon Noel: I built in the site.

248
00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:55,770
Leon Noel: And in that moment, something very clear happened in my brain that I had a real skill, a skill that could provide, that could put food on the table, a skill that would make it.

249
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,731
Leon Noel: so I was never fucking hungry again.

250
00:21:57,751 --> 00:21:58,531
Leon Noel: Sorry, oops, sorry, Chris.

251
00:21:58,992 --> 00:21:59,552
Quincy Larson: It's cool.

252
00:21:59,572 --> 00:22:00,492
Leon Noel: Again, again.

253
00:22:00,912 --> 00:22:05,914
Quincy Larson: Yeah, if anybody like, we don't edit this podcast at all, so I'm not gonna edit out the swear words.

254
00:22:05,954 --> 00:22:10,216
Quincy Larson: That's like a, unless there's like something really bad that happens, like I had a coughing fit once.

255
00:22:13,137 --> 00:22:15,018
Leon Noel: And so that changed everything.

256
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:34,926
Leon Noel: Until this day, I still freelance and I, that's the reason why a lot of the things I do today, the resilient coders, the 100 devs is like, I want anybody that's ever felt that way to know that there is this option, this ability to develop skills that no one can take away from you, that can put legitimate food on the table.

257
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:38,728
Leon Noel: And so that's when I kind of went all in on more of the engineering piece.

258
00:22:40,396 --> 00:22:40,676
Quincy Larson: Awesome.

259
00:22:41,137 --> 00:22:47,142
Quincy Larson: Yeah, well, um, that sounds like an amazing discovery of like powers that you just had latent within you.

260
00:22:47,723 --> 00:22:52,247
Quincy Larson: that necessity brought forth, you know, necessity is the mother of invention, right?

261
00:22:53,689 --> 00:23:01,256
Quincy Larson: You were forced to basically by your circumstance to like, think outside the proverbial box, come up with a way to get money to buy your pasta.

262
00:23:01,936 --> 00:23:06,880
Quincy Larson: Um, I, you know, I definitely, uh, remember the lean college.

263
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,521
Quincy Larson: Here's some sissing off pasta.

264
00:23:08,881 --> 00:23:10,102
Quincy Larson: We got the smack ramen.

265
00:23:10,262 --> 00:23:14,945
Quincy Larson: If anybody, like, not the good, like, ramyun, like Korean ramen, but like, it was just called smack.

266
00:23:16,486 --> 00:23:17,467
Quincy Larson: We'd always joke about it.

267
00:23:17,547 --> 00:23:24,832
Quincy Larson: Like when you're hungry enough, it's almost like, you know, like a drug because it's just like, you feel so sated afterward.

268
00:23:24,852 --> 00:23:26,753
Quincy Larson: It's terrible for you.

269
00:23:27,193 --> 00:23:28,434
Quincy Larson: But what kind of pasta?

270
00:23:28,594 --> 00:23:32,416
Quincy Larson: Did you have a particular build of pasta that you liked?

271
00:23:32,436 --> 00:23:35,418
Leon Noel: This is way back.

272
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:38,280
Leon Noel: Whatever the cheapest was, I was going to survive.

273
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:38,820
Leon Noel: I didn't care.

274
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,221
Leon Noel: Nowadays, I probably have some preferences.

275
00:23:40,281 --> 00:23:47,245
Leon Noel: But back then, whatever was on sale, whatever was the cheapest, the supermarket nearest had this clearance aisle.

276
00:23:47,725 --> 00:23:50,287
Leon Noel: And in that clearance aisle, they would put the stuff they couldn't sell.

277
00:23:50,447 --> 00:23:53,749
Leon Noel: And so whatever was on that rack is what I would grab.

278
00:23:54,301 --> 00:23:54,621
Leon Noel: Yeah.

279
00:23:55,161 --> 00:23:55,381
Quincy Larson: Yeah.

280
00:23:55,902 --> 00:24:07,905
Quincy Larson: And to this day, by the way, like a lot of grocery stores like Walmart, like they'll take their baked goods and put them on a rack like right by the exit, like the staff only place where they have like the garbage compactor where they compact the boxes.

281
00:24:07,985 --> 00:24:09,626
Quincy Larson: Like I worked in grocery stores for a few years.

282
00:24:10,066 --> 00:24:14,308
Quincy Larson: So basically back where they keep all the mobs and they keep all the, you know, inventory.

283
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:17,469
Quincy Larson: There will be like a little rack and sometimes they'll have baked goods.

284
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:21,851
Quincy Larson: They're like, it's still good, but we can't really sell it because it's going to expire in like a day or two.

285
00:24:21,931 --> 00:24:24,652
Quincy Larson: So like I stole snacks and bargains from there.

286
00:24:25,513 --> 00:24:28,874
Quincy Larson: But but yeah, just pro tip, if you're going to a U.S.

287
00:24:29,475 --> 00:24:34,277
Quincy Larson: grocery store, you can often find like food that's about to expire that you can get like at a heavy discount.

288
00:24:35,257 --> 00:24:36,958
Quincy Larson: So that's really cool.

289
00:24:36,998 --> 00:24:38,699
Quincy Larson: So how did things unfold from there?

290
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:49,887
Quincy Larson: So how did you go from that first contract work, essentially, that client that you landed through Craigslist, which is how I landed, I think I landed some early clients through Craigslist.

291
00:24:49,927 --> 00:24:51,148
Quincy Larson: Craigslist, amazing tool.

292
00:24:51,168 --> 00:24:55,831
Quincy Larson: I'm not sure if it's still amazing today, like 12 years since I last used it.

293
00:24:55,871 --> 00:24:59,753
Quincy Larson: But yeah, like a lot of early gigs were found on Craigslist.

294
00:25:00,294 --> 00:25:08,676
Quincy Larson: How did you go from that to, the deciding, I am a dev, like taking that identity, if you will, and going deeper with it.

295
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:09,957
Leon Noel: Yeah, sure.

296
00:25:10,097 --> 00:25:19,238
Leon Noel: So my junior year at Yale, I started a small website called Listful of Hope.

297
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:26,000
Leon Noel: It was kind of like a reverse Craigslist, where if you needed something, you could say what you needed.

298
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:30,481
Leon Noel: So if you needed a jacket and someone in the area had a jacket, you would meet up and they would give you a jacket.

299
00:25:30,561 --> 00:25:31,981
Leon Noel: So it was kind of like a gift economy.

300
00:25:32,641 --> 00:25:37,482
Leon Noel: It was a very simple site that was just enabling folks to help others in their community.

301
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:41,043
Leon Noel: And it really kind of popped off in New Haven.

302
00:25:41,423 --> 00:25:44,724
Leon Noel: And so there was the one winter where it was really popular.

303
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:48,925
Leon Noel: I remember people getting Christmas presents, jackets, gloves, anything you needed.

304
00:25:49,706 --> 00:25:58,128
Leon Noel: And I could really see that transition from something that was just a raw skill to me having to build an actual application and having real users.

305
00:25:59,168 --> 00:25:59,908
Leon Noel: I was hooked.

306
00:25:59,948 --> 00:26:01,149
Leon Noel: I saw the power.

307
00:26:01,189 --> 00:26:03,490
Leon Noel: I saw that it could help so many people.

308
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:07,212
Leon Noel: And I knew that these skills would be really advantageous to keep going.

309
00:26:07,252 --> 00:26:09,913
Leon Noel: So my junior year, I kind of slowly stopped.

310
00:26:11,004 --> 00:26:12,826
Leon Noel: kind of really wanting to do coursework.

311
00:26:13,586 --> 00:26:30,320
Leon Noel: Senior year, it became an even bigger problem, and I was trying to finish my thesis to graduate, and I had to get, like, 300 men to spit in a tube, tell me about their sexual histories so I could correlate it to their testosterone levels.

312
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:37,506
Leon Noel: I was trying to, like, show that or find something about BPA in relation to testosterone.

313
00:26:37,526 --> 00:26:40,609
Leon Noel: So we drank a lot of plastic water bottles.

314
00:26:40,949 --> 00:26:44,973
Leon Noel: And so I was trying to do that before it became really popular, like something people would actually think about.

315
00:26:44,993 --> 00:26:47,435
Quincy Larson: BPA-free plastic, which would be good for the kids.

316
00:26:47,655 --> 00:26:50,597
Quincy Larson: Just in case, BPA does have deleterious effects.

317
00:26:50,637 --> 00:26:53,280
Quincy Larson: We don't want our kids to be drinking from BPA water bottles.

318
00:26:53,920 --> 00:27:05,395
Leon Noel: really hard time running that that experiment and apparently people didn't want to you know spit in a tube and tell me about their sexual history for like a bottle of Gatorade and like a pack of gum or something.

319
00:27:05,456 --> 00:27:26,245
Leon Noel: and so I wasn't able to recruit enough people for that experiment and I decided to use my coding skills to set up a landing page where a lot of students were always trying to find studies or experiments to participate in because one, they were a lot of fun sometimes and you actually got paid pretty well to do the experiments.

320
00:27:27,006 --> 00:27:36,556
Leon Noel: There is one really famous one that people loved where you basically went to a lab, they got you drunk and you played poker, and they're just watching you, how you make risky decisions and things like that.

321
00:27:37,037 --> 00:27:38,738
Leon Noel: You got paid a couple hundred dollars to do it.

322
00:27:39,139 --> 00:27:39,379
Leon Noel: Wow.

323
00:27:39,439 --> 00:27:48,608
Leon Noel: So I made a landing page that had all the studies from Yale, Harvard, Princeton that were trying to get people to come, and I just slipped mine in there.

324
00:27:49,489 --> 00:28:03,365
Leon Noel: And it took off because we had all these professors that were promoting it, we had all these students that got real value, they went to the site, they found something fun to do, they got money, and I dropped out my senior year to turn that into a business.

325
00:28:04,546 --> 00:28:10,610
Leon Noel: which became SocialSci, and we wound up building academic surveying tools.

326
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:15,933
Leon Noel: We had over 4,000 different universities that used our tools to power their academic research.

327
00:28:16,573 --> 00:28:23,497
Leon Noel: And even though that company has been wrapped up for a long time now, we still have research that gets published based off of the data that they collected.

328
00:28:24,018 --> 00:28:26,299
Leon Noel: I needed to know more.

329
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:32,742
Leon Noel: My engineers had these magical powers, and I needed to learn that skill for myself.

330
00:28:32,842 --> 00:28:36,423
Leon Noel: And so I took my coding education more seriously.

331
00:28:37,203 --> 00:28:47,127
Leon Noel: Eventually, I was building other products, other startups as well, and started teaching at General Assembly, helping others acquire these skills too.

332
00:28:47,187 --> 00:28:48,508
Leon Noel: So that was the journey.

333
00:28:49,248 --> 00:28:49,708
Quincy Larson: It's interesting.

334
00:28:49,748 --> 00:29:03,634
Quincy Larson: So first of all, congratulations on building something that 4,000 universities Yeah, it's not easy to get universities to use your stuff like there's like this notorious like sales cycle adoption cycle among universities.

335
00:29:03,674 --> 00:29:06,875
Quincy Larson: They're they're very like slow to adopt new tools.

336
00:29:06,895 --> 00:29:19,697
Quincy Larson: Yeah, I mean that's that's phenomenal to go from basically like mechanical Turk for being a human test subject to having like an actual project that is getting wide usage.

337
00:29:20,477 --> 00:29:20,958
Quincy Larson: That's really amazing.

338
00:29:20,978 --> 00:29:23,018
Leon Noel: It's funny that you bring up Mechanical Turk.

339
00:29:23,078 --> 00:29:29,381
Leon Noel: That was the reason why we were able to raise VC funding, was because MTurk was becoming more popular.

340
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:37,704
Leon Noel: And what Social Science solved was not just the survey creation, but the participants taking the surveys.

341
00:29:38,244 --> 00:29:43,827
Leon Noel: And so part of my pitch deck, and I'll never forget it, was I decided to get my mom a Christmas card.

342
00:29:44,187 --> 00:29:46,168
Leon Noel: And I had people on MTurk.

343
00:29:47,642 --> 00:29:50,625
Leon Noel: just like hold up the Merry Christmas sign.

344
00:29:51,306 --> 00:29:56,993
Leon Noel: And what we had was this one person with a hundred different, like not a hundred, but like a lot of different accounts.

345
00:29:57,273 --> 00:30:00,136
Leon Noel: that was just like changing their hat, putting on a different shirt.

346
00:30:00,437 --> 00:30:02,419
Leon Noel: But it was like clearly the same person.

347
00:30:02,879 --> 00:30:08,506
Leon Noel: And so at this point, Mechanical Turk hadn't solved the like identity online and like how do you stop?

348
00:30:08,886 --> 00:30:20,076
Leon Noel: like false participants and that was kind of why we were able to be able to raise money and why we were able to have so many universities trust and use our service because we were solving that problem specifically.

349
00:30:20,472 --> 00:30:22,152
Quincy Larson: So it was your mom like, who is this person?

350
00:30:22,212 --> 00:30:26,674
Quincy Larson: And why are they so passionate about wishing me a happy birthday?

351
00:30:26,734 --> 00:30:27,434
Quincy Larson: It was cool.

352
00:30:27,474 --> 00:30:33,735
Leon Noel: There was like 100 people from all over the world with different backgrounds, different cities, different places.

353
00:30:33,835 --> 00:30:35,336
Leon Noel: And they all were saying Merry Christmas.

354
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,556
Leon Noel: Nowadays, you can probably facilitate that.

355
00:30:37,596 --> 00:30:39,877
Leon Noel: But back when we did it, it was pretty cool.

356
00:30:40,856 --> 00:30:47,158
Quincy Larson: Yeah, and Mechanical Turk, just for people that are unfamiliar with it, they call it artificial intelligence.

357
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:54,541
Quincy Larson: Obviously, nowadays, a lot of things you would pay someone on Mechanical Turk to do, you just form out to an LLM or something.

358
00:30:54,601 --> 00:30:58,102
Quincy Larson: But it was like, hey, I need you.

359
00:30:58,462 --> 00:31:01,203
Quincy Larson: Early on, it was like, hey, I need you to solve a capture for me.

360
00:31:01,364 --> 00:31:05,945
Quincy Larson: Or hey, I need you to create a Facebook account and like this Facebook group or something like that.

361
00:31:06,005 --> 00:31:07,706
Quincy Larson: It was basically getting around.

362
00:31:08,146 --> 00:31:10,688
Quincy Larson: the restrictions that different platforms might have in place.

363
00:31:11,589 --> 00:31:20,956
Quincy Larson: But in the good, as designed use, would be, for example, getting people to do precisely what Leon said.

364
00:31:21,056 --> 00:31:25,000
Quincy Larson: So everybody would get maybe just a few pennies.

365
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,522
Quincy Larson: Or doing a hit, I think, or a job or something.

366
00:31:28,542 --> 00:31:29,463
Quincy Larson: I can't remember what they were called.

367
00:31:29,963 --> 00:31:32,385
Quincy Larson: But yeah, you would do those.

368
00:31:32,985 --> 00:31:33,745
Quincy Larson: Is that accurate?

369
00:31:33,765 --> 00:31:34,946
Quincy Larson: I haven't actually used it.

370
00:31:35,006 --> 00:31:36,287
Leon Noel: Yeah, no, that's pretty close.

371
00:31:36,667 --> 00:31:40,490
Leon Noel: It's this whole subfield called human computation, right?

372
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:41,371
Quincy Larson: Human computation.

373
00:31:43,792 --> 00:31:52,339
Leon Noel: Some things that computers can't yet do that humans can still do, but figuring out how to do them at scale is really important.

374
00:31:52,359 --> 00:32:00,466
Leon Noel: And so Mechanical Turk, you can take a task, break it down into a very small subtask and have thousands and thousands of people do it.

375
00:32:01,047 --> 00:32:03,209
Leon Noel: Need for human computation is like labeling data.

376
00:32:03,229 --> 00:32:05,290
Leon Noel: Think of like AI training and things like that.

377
00:32:06,211 --> 00:32:06,752
Leon Noel: Who are the people?

378
00:32:06,812 --> 00:32:13,658
Leon Noel: Like there had to be real people that said that was a a fire hose, or that was a car, or that was a bicycle.

379
00:32:13,738 --> 00:32:15,620
Quincy Larson: That's a chihuahua and not a muffin.

380
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,222
Leon Noel: Exactly.

381
00:32:17,242 --> 00:32:19,484
Quincy Larson: Chihuahuas look a lot like muffins to a computer.

382
00:32:20,966 --> 00:32:26,996
Leon Noel: And so figuring out all of that was necessary for a lot of the advancements that we're seeing now.

383
00:32:27,356 --> 00:32:31,360
Leon Noel: And there are still things that humans can do very quickly that machines just can't do yet.

384
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,863
Leon Noel: And so MTurk still has a good place.

385
00:32:34,883 --> 00:32:41,569
Leon Noel: There are other companies that do similar things nowadays, of course, but that labeling and small tasks done at scale.

386
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:43,551
Leon Noel: And there are other cool things you can do too.

387
00:32:43,611 --> 00:32:53,845
Leon Noel: So where it's like Instead of giving it to just one person, you give it to five, and if four out of the five do one thing, you know that you can probably trust that thing as opposed to the one person that did it.

388
00:32:53,885 --> 00:32:55,467
Quincy Larson: As opposed to the minority report.

389
00:32:56,068 --> 00:32:57,190
Quincy Larson: Yeah.

390
00:32:57,931 --> 00:32:58,792
Quincy Larson: The dissenting opinion.

391
00:32:58,812 --> 00:33:01,136
Quincy Larson: Yeah, that's a good kind of consensus mechanism.

392
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,397
Quincy Larson: So, um, okay cool.

393
00:33:03,498 --> 00:33:04,378
Quincy Larson: So you built this project.

394
00:33:04,678 --> 00:33:07,421
Quincy Larson: we could talk about that a lot more but we have so much more to talk about.

395
00:33:07,561 --> 00:33:08,862
Quincy Larson: Yeah, where do you go from there?

396
00:33:08,902 --> 00:33:12,565
Quincy Larson: You you basically had a successful project, right?

397
00:33:12,585 --> 00:33:14,986
Quincy Larson: Like everybody's dream, especially at this point.

398
00:33:15,007 --> 00:33:20,311
Quincy Larson: It sounds like you're pretty young like yeah, like had you finished college at this point like I.

399
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:22,072
Leon Noel: so I dropped out and never finished.

400
00:33:22,532 --> 00:33:27,598
Leon Noel: Oh, wow In my senior year at Yale, I had this idea for Social Sci.

401
00:33:27,618 --> 00:33:28,799
Leon Noel: I dropped out.

402
00:33:28,879 --> 00:33:30,001
Leon Noel: I did Techstars.

403
00:33:30,021 --> 00:33:32,263
Quincy Larson: Techstars, an accelerator.

404
00:33:32,764 --> 00:33:33,164
Leon Noel: Yeah.

405
00:33:33,305 --> 00:33:38,290
Quincy Larson: Popular, like they give you some seed money and then you're in like a program where they kind of coach you?

406
00:33:38,991 --> 00:33:39,291
Leon Noel: Exactly.

407
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:40,192
Quincy Larson: Is that accurate?

408
00:33:40,292 --> 00:33:40,892
Leon Noel: Yeah, exactly.

409
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:47,515
Leon Noel: They help you lay the foundation for a company and all the skills you might need to know to do that effectively.

410
00:33:48,095 --> 00:33:49,556
Leon Noel: TechStars really changed my life.

411
00:33:49,636 --> 00:33:51,737
Leon Noel: It really gave me a lot of the skills that I was missing.

412
00:33:52,477 --> 00:34:00,541
Leon Noel: Gave me my initial network outside of university and the initial seed funding and then helped me go on to raise more funds for SocialSci.

413
00:34:01,101 --> 00:34:15,033
Leon Noel: yeah, while I was running Social Sci, I started teaching at General Assembly, and so General Assembly is one of the first like really big coding boot camp programs, and I was doing their part-time courses for a very long time.

414
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:29,350
Leon Noel: I'm a distinguished faculty with GA even until today, and I was having just hundreds, if not thousands of people be successful, like learning these new skills, learning how to code, getting great jobs.

415
00:34:30,091 --> 00:34:39,255
Leon Noel: And at one point it kind of just got overwhelming that I didn't notice anyone that looked like me taking advantage of this program.

416
00:34:40,097 --> 00:34:41,918
Leon Noel: One, because it costs a lot of money.

417
00:34:41,938 --> 00:34:43,779
Leon Noel: It also costs a lot of time.

418
00:34:43,799 --> 00:35:07,173
Leon Noel: And so I started looking for orgs near me in Boston that I could help or support, and I came across Resilient Coders, which at that time, our founder, David Delmar, was really trying to work with court-involved youth and show them, hey, there are these things you could be doing, like coding or things like that, that might help you long-term in life.

419
00:35:07,233 --> 00:35:22,981
Leon Noel: And so, I started just going to, we had what are called community hours, where it was just myself, a few other mentors, and a bunch of young folks that were typically court involved or a returning citizen, and just trying to give them these skills.

420
00:35:23,141 --> 00:35:28,182
Leon Noel: And then we had the idea of starting a boot camp.

421
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:33,783
Leon Noel: And our founder, David Delmar, said, hey, you've been running these other boot camp programs.

422
00:35:34,003 --> 00:35:35,384
Leon Noel: Could you do it for RC?

423
00:35:35,764 --> 00:35:36,284
Leon Noel: Said yes.

424
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:54,088
Leon Noel: And then for the past six years, we've built a program that can help folks traditionally of color that have Particularly not completed a degree, go from zero to employable as a software engineer and we've been pretty successful at it.

425
00:35:54,108 --> 00:35:55,769
Leon Noel: we've helped hundreds of folks get jobs.

426
00:35:56,869 --> 00:35:58,190
Leon Noel: And what starting salaries?

427
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:58,530
Leon Noel: around $92,000.

428
00:35:58,530 --> 00:35:59,750
Leon Noel: and for us that's huge because.

429
00:36:03,331 --> 00:36:11,037
Leon Noel: for each person we can get from those communities, we're talking about millions and millions of dollars back into those communities over the lifespan of their career.

430
00:36:11,117 --> 00:36:13,939
Leon Noel: So started doing resilient coders.

431
00:36:13,979 --> 00:36:15,440
Leon Noel: that eventually led me to 100 devs.

432
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,421
Quincy Larson: And that's kind of the way forward.

433
00:36:17,822 --> 00:36:25,447
Quincy Larson: I want to dive a little more into because we're going to talk a lot about 100 devs, but like resilient coders, you said court involved youth.

434
00:36:26,668 --> 00:36:53,776
Quincy Larson: I'm not familiar with the term, but like, you know, I have lots of friends who are like convicted felons and I'm not sure if that if that is essentially like people who early on in life get into trouble maybe because they actually did something wrong or maybe they were profiled and like the very unequal justice system in the United States didn't do its job very well and you know gave them much harsher penalty than a kid should probably have in many cases.

435
00:36:54,736 --> 00:36:58,022
Quincy Larson: but Uh, is that like accurate?

436
00:36:58,062 --> 00:36:58,702
Quincy Larson: It's like, yeah.

437
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:11,653
Leon Noel: So we had a lot of individuals that we say court involved because exactly the things that you brought up, a lot of the folks that we were working with, they didn't do anything wrong and they were just the wrong place, the wrong time.

438
00:37:11,673 --> 00:37:19,439
Leon Noel: We did have folks that had gone down a different path in life to do the things they needed to do, provide for themselves and their families.

439
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:26,125
Leon Noel: And so we wanted to give them a clear path forward to do the the thing with their loved ones.

440
00:37:26,186 --> 00:37:36,297
Leon Noel: And so we're trying to get them skills, just skills that they can put into practice to get to a point to where they had a strong, stable, high growth career.

441
00:37:36,357 --> 00:37:38,459
Leon Noel: And then that's kind of the birth of RC.

442
00:37:39,901 --> 00:37:54,855
Leon Noel: And our dirty little secret that I guess some folks know is that the first dollars we ever took in were from the Boston Police Department because they saw our program as, hey, we're going to spend all this money on incarceration, rehabilitation.

443
00:37:56,156 --> 00:37:58,138
Leon Noel: Why not get ahead of it?

444
00:37:58,799 --> 00:38:01,021
Leon Noel: And they gave us some funding to help run our first boot camp.

445
00:38:01,874 --> 00:38:02,734
Quincy Larson: Yeah, that's awesome.

446
00:38:03,395 --> 00:38:09,338
Quincy Larson: Well, it sounds like it was money well spent, given the impact you all have had over the past six years, I think you said.

447
00:38:10,658 --> 00:38:13,260
Quincy Larson: So you've got resilient coders going.

448
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:24,305
Quincy Larson: You're teaching there, and it sounds like you're having a big impact, but was there a moment where you're like, I can have an even bigger impact by leveraging the power of the internet?

449
00:38:24,325 --> 00:38:29,767
Quincy Larson: Like, what was the process that, and maybe I can back up a second and just say, what is 100 devs?

450
00:38:31,164 --> 00:38:33,325
Leon Noel: Yeah, sure.

451
00:38:33,345 --> 00:38:44,429
Leon Noel: So 100Devs is a collection of engineers that help build a completely free, live software engineering training program for anyone, anywhere.

452
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:46,991
Leon Noel: That was kind of our genesis.

453
00:38:47,251 --> 00:38:57,395
Leon Noel: Now we're also building, and we're going to be piloting this year, a full-service digital agency where real clients come to us to build products.

454
00:38:58,335 --> 00:39:03,880
Leon Noel: and get to tap into our amazing alumni that have gone on to work at some of the best tech companies in the world.

455
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,183
Leon Noel: We're talking Amazon, LinkedIn, Slack, you name it.

456
00:39:07,203 --> 00:39:08,384
Leon Noel: We have an alumni there.

457
00:39:08,404 --> 00:39:10,546
Leon Noel: They come back to work on these projects.

458
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:13,789
Leon Noel: Each project is getting broken down into individual tasks.

459
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:21,876
Leon Noel: And then as you're learning, you're also building real code for real companies and getting paid actual money to do it.

460
00:39:22,557 --> 00:39:38,882
Leon Noel: We mentioned early on that free isn't always free because it requires you to have an extreme privilege of time to work through all this material to give up your nights and weekends, and we want to do something that helps soften the blow for folks that are going through our program.

461
00:39:39,562 --> 00:39:40,943
Leon Noel: Our program is entirely free.

462
00:39:41,864 --> 00:39:45,186
Leon Noel: Every resource I have ever given out is always free.

463
00:39:45,226 --> 00:39:50,369
Leon Noel: I don't work with anybody that doesn't have a free version or something that we can have access to.

464
00:39:50,829 --> 00:40:02,917
Leon Noel: But we did a poll not too long ago that said, hey, we realize a lot of you can't commit the time or take the time away from putting food on the table.

465
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:03,897
Leon Noel: What would it take?

466
00:40:04,998 --> 00:40:05,939
Leon Noel: for you to be able to focus.

467
00:40:06,379 --> 00:40:08,981
Leon Noel: And it was $200 a week was the average.

468
00:40:09,561 --> 00:40:10,342
Leon Noel: We can make that happen.

469
00:40:10,362 --> 00:40:16,987
Leon Noel: We can figure out a way to get folks those funds so that they can focus and get through a program like 100 Devs.

470
00:40:17,067 --> 00:40:18,988
Leon Noel: And yeah, so now we're a global community.

471
00:40:19,028 --> 00:40:22,150
Leon Noel: Our Discord is 60,000 plus strong.

472
00:40:22,791 --> 00:40:24,612
Leon Noel: We have alumni all around the world.

473
00:40:24,752 --> 00:40:41,001
Leon Noel: And we're just trying to figure out a way for folks to be able to unlock a stable, high growth career put food on the table, support themselves and their family and their loved ones, and luckily we found a lot of folks that believe in that idea in mission

474
00:40:41,001 --> 00:40:41,521
Quincy Larson: 2 and we built

475
00:40:41,541 --> 00:40:42,482
Leon Noel: a wonderful community around

476
00:40:42,522 --> 00:40:42,582
Quincy Larson: it.

477
00:40:42,802 --> 00:40:47,443
Quincy Larson: Yeah, and so the mechanics of the community, like.

478
00:40:47,463 --> 00:41:03,452
Quincy Larson: first of all, it goes without saying that I'm in awe of what you all are accomplishing with HunterDevs and I've had so many positive interactions with people who are both using like the free CodeCamp curriculum and in the 100 devs, I guess you'd call it like a cohort or an intake.

479
00:41:03,772 --> 00:41:10,176
Quincy Larson: Like basically a bunch of people working together through a set kind of like week-to-week program.

480
00:41:10,276 --> 00:41:16,559
Quincy Larson: And I, you know, free CodeCamp, we have experimented with like cohorted programs and like, let's see if we can get all these people.

481
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,541
Quincy Larson: But what we found is like, it's a lot of work to organize.

482
00:41:20,962 --> 00:41:26,807
Quincy Larson: very aware of and like free code camp philosophy is like, let's just build the resources at scale, put them out there.

483
00:41:27,988 --> 00:41:28,248
Quincy Larson: Yes.

484
00:41:28,809 --> 00:41:36,876
Quincy Larson: Lots of kids who are the, you know, the son or daughter of like software engineers in Palo Alto are going to use free code camp and they're going to use it for free.

485
00:41:36,976 --> 00:41:42,461
Quincy Larson: And they, you know, probably could have paid a bunch of money to have a computer science student, like tutor them or something.

486
00:41:42,481 --> 00:41:42,621
Quincy Larson: Right.

487
00:41:43,161 --> 00:41:57,049
Quincy Larson: But also a lot of kids who are in like a village in rural India or in like kind of like a failed state, which a lot of people have smartphones and can't get on the Internet, even in places like Somalia.

488
00:41:57,109 --> 00:41:57,309
Quincy Larson: Right.

489
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:59,211
Quincy Larson: North Korea.

490
00:41:59,751 --> 00:41:59,971
Quincy Larson: Right.

491
00:42:00,031 --> 00:42:02,332
Quincy Larson: People in North Korea use free code camp sometimes.

492
00:42:02,973 --> 00:42:05,334
Quincy Larson: And essentially they can.

493
00:42:05,514 --> 00:42:06,015
Quincy Larson: they can learn.

494
00:42:06,895 --> 00:42:17,820
Quincy Larson: even though it would be normally prohibitively expensive for them to buy a $20 course on a course website, for example.

495
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:27,844
Quincy Larson: And so our philosophy is we need to make sure that there is a baseline, that everybody has access to comprehensive math, programming, computer science, and English education.

496
00:42:28,884 --> 00:42:36,953
Quincy Larson: So that everybody, regardless of their circumstances, if they have time, which not everybody does, but if they have time or they can figure out techniques to make

497
00:42:36,993 --> 00:42:37,273
Leon Noel: time,

498
00:42:38,354 --> 00:42:45,622
Quincy Larson: to learn even a little each day, then they can make steady forward progress toward the eventual goal of working as a software engineer.

499
00:42:46,078 --> 00:42:46,238
Quincy Larson: Right?

500
00:42:46,538 --> 00:42:59,402
Quincy Larson: So, so that is kind of like our philosophy is like, let's just make tons of really high quality, free stuff that's essentially subsidized by the community, like the people who are able to give the alumni.

501
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:04,663
Quincy Larson: Sometimes, like we got a gift for $250,000 the other day from CompTIA.

502
00:43:04,983 --> 00:43:10,565
Quincy Larson: The CEO of CompTIA is a fan of FreeCodeCamp and uses FreeCodeCamp to expand his JavaScript knowledge.

503
00:43:10,685 --> 00:43:11,325
Quincy Larson: Super chill dude.

504
00:43:11,945 --> 00:43:17,327
Quincy Larson: You know, Daryl Silver, founder of Thinkful, kicked in $150,000.

505
00:43:17,327 --> 00:43:25,130
Quincy Larson: And then, of course, we're getting grants from, like, you know, Linux Foundation and MongoDB and Google and a lot of other organizations.

506
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:29,552
Quincy Larson: But a vast majority of our support comes directly from the community, from people who donate.

507
00:43:29,592 --> 00:43:31,432
Quincy Larson: So, freecodegame.org slash donate.

508
00:43:31,812 --> 00:43:33,533
Leon Noel: All right, but my point is.

509
00:43:34,093 --> 00:43:35,354
Quincy Larson: Oh, yeah, and thank you.

510
00:43:35,374 --> 00:43:36,754
Quincy Larson: Thank you for supporting our charity.

511
00:43:37,135 --> 00:43:38,775
Quincy Larson: I didn't even realize, I apologize.

512
00:43:39,856 --> 00:43:44,157
Quincy Larson: But maybe you're getting my periodic donor email, like I said, a donor email.

513
00:43:44,338 --> 00:43:44,478
Quincy Larson: Yeah.

514
00:43:47,102 --> 00:43:54,026
Quincy Larson: My point in all this little tangent is to say that Free Code Camp, we don't have the bandwidth to do things that don't scale.

515
00:43:55,147 --> 00:43:58,849
Quincy Larson: And you are doing things that don't scale at all, really.

516
00:43:58,909 --> 00:44:02,171
Quincy Larson: Maybe you figured out some techniques to get cohorts to scale.

517
00:44:02,351 --> 00:44:04,472
Quincy Larson: Because you mentioned your Discord has 60,000 people in it.

518
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:14,858
Quincy Larson: actually getting on stream and like teaching for like a marathon three five hours like however long you go.

519
00:44:14,878 --> 00:44:16,258
Quincy Larson: it's really inspiring.

520
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:19,580
Quincy Larson: uh definitely catch some of the live streams if you can or i've watched.

521
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,341
Quincy Larson: i watch everything at double speed so i watch like the video on demand.

522
00:44:22,801 --> 00:44:23,321
Quincy Larson: yeah that.

523
00:44:23,741 --> 00:44:35,771
Quincy Larson: but uh like I guess you saw from coming from the like intensive program where you're teaching folks like you saw the merit of quality not just quantity or like.

524
00:44:36,211 --> 00:44:37,172
Quincy Larson: I guess like content.

525
00:44:37,212 --> 00:44:40,315
Quincy Larson: like I'm not like doing things that don't scale really.

526
00:44:40,835 --> 00:44:46,897
Quincy Larson: And helping people individually doesn't really scale, but that's not necessarily the idea.

527
00:44:46,957 --> 00:44:59,441
Quincy Larson: The idea is to give a whole lot of attention to a smaller number of people and to really make sure that those people can ramp up to, you know, an impressive, he said like, what was the figure?

528
00:44:59,461 --> 00:45:02,962
Quincy Larson: you said was like the median income of people who graduated?

529
00:45:02,962 --> 00:45:04,782
Leon Noel: $19,000 for first time coders, yeah.

530
00:45:06,883 --> 00:45:12,285
Quincy Larson: That's a lot more than I made in my first developer job, given if it is in Boston, like the cost of living might be higher.

531
00:45:12,325 --> 00:45:16,327
Quincy Larson: But I mean, that's a lot of freaking money for people that like.

532
00:45:16,347 --> 00:45:19,848
Quincy Larson: I imagine some of these people don't have university degrees.

533
00:45:19,928 --> 00:45:28,152
Quincy Larson: I didn't even know that you hadn't completed your degree, although dropping out of Yale is probably very different from dropping out of like, you know, Central State University, right?

534
00:45:29,452 --> 00:45:29,672
Quincy Larson: Yeah.

535
00:45:30,072 --> 00:45:32,413
Quincy Larson: But sorry, I've been talking for the last three minutes.

536
00:45:32,493 --> 00:45:35,494
Quincy Larson: I'm just very excited about how you approach this.

537
00:45:35,954 --> 00:45:42,896
Quincy Larson: And I want to make sure our audience appreciates the, I guess, counterintuitiveness of what you've done.

538
00:45:44,416 --> 00:45:49,863
Quincy Larson: And how you've been able to like, people weren't doing this because it was perhaps counterintuitive to do so.

539
00:45:49,943 --> 00:45:50,903
Quincy Larson: It was probably very daunting.

540
00:45:50,923 --> 00:45:51,524
Leon Noel: It's a bad idea.

541
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:52,284
Leon Noel: Don't do it.

542
00:45:54,266 --> 00:45:54,546
Leon Noel: Yeah.

543
00:45:54,586 --> 00:46:02,872
Quincy Larson: So maybe you can talk about that, how you have to do stuff that doesn't scale, and ways that it doesn't scale, and then ways, techniques you figured out to scale it a little bit.

544
00:46:03,593 --> 00:46:03,813
Leon Noel: Sure.

545
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:04,493
Leon Noel: Yeah, happy to.

546
00:46:04,934 --> 00:46:07,916
Leon Noel: I think the first thing, though, is just shout out Free Code Camp.

547
00:46:08,036 --> 00:46:11,679
Leon Noel: You all laid the foundation for so many folks to learn.

548
00:46:11,739 --> 00:46:26,200
Leon Noel: And one of the things I am always hyping, especially in 100,000, our Discord is, I think a lot of folks that go into this space don't put in the work to do the things that really matter the most.

549
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:31,044
Leon Noel: And so one of the things I've always admired about free code camp is like this commitment to filling the gaps.

550
00:46:31,184 --> 00:46:35,688
Leon Noel: And so realizing that most people don't have the privilege of speaking English.

551
00:46:35,708 --> 00:46:38,290
Leon Noel: So we're gonna build a full, like, how do you speak English?

552
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:40,072
Leon Noel: course, right?

553
00:46:40,112 --> 00:46:40,552
Leon Noel: That's huge.

554
00:46:40,612 --> 00:46:48,808
Leon Noel: It's like very progressively thinking about what do our folks going through our program absolutely need.

555
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:52,651
Leon Noel: And so that's why I'm so happy that Free Code Camp exists.

556
00:46:52,712 --> 00:47:00,499
Leon Noel: It's why it's one of the first things I always recommend to new folks getting into tech and why I think you all will continue to be so successful.

557
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:05,183
Leon Noel: because it's just like this relentless pursuit of making tech more equitable to everyone.

558
00:47:06,264 --> 00:47:14,795
Leon Noel: That's why I said really early on in this conversation, I look up to you so much, and a lot of that ethos is what I've tried to bring to 100Devs.

559
00:47:15,115 --> 00:47:20,301
Leon Noel: For 100Devs, we got started during the pandemic, and the pandemic hit.

560
00:47:21,511 --> 00:47:23,473
Leon Noel: things got really bad really quickly.

561
00:47:23,814 --> 00:47:35,567
Leon Noel: So people always like to talk in Boston about like a 2% unemployment rate, but I knew just from looking at the actual data, we looked in our communities of color is already at 12%.

562
00:47:35,567 --> 00:47:36,808
Leon Noel: This is pre-pandemic.

563
00:47:37,369 --> 00:47:42,013
Leon Noel: If you look during the pandemic, it jumped from 12 to like 33% in some communities.

564
00:47:42,653 --> 00:47:45,175
Leon Noel: And so it got real bad real quick.

565
00:47:45,195 --> 00:48:00,808
Leon Noel: And I just, if you are already in tech or if you already come from a privileged background, I don't think people really understand what that means when right now, like if you look at the most recent like labor data, like the median income, median, median is 56,000 in the US.

566
00:48:01,429 --> 00:48:09,893
Leon Noel: And so if we have, that percent of folks under it, and we're seeing 33 percent unemployment, and then labor data actually includes eligible workers.

567
00:48:10,393 --> 00:48:15,275
Leon Noel: It just got real bad real quick and it continues to be a really rough situation for folks.

568
00:48:16,236 --> 00:48:17,216
Leon Noel: I'm not a doctor.

569
00:48:17,896 --> 00:48:30,382
Leon Noel: I didn't have a skill that I thought that could be helpful to folks that were being affected by the pandemic, but I had been teaching for a while and I knew that I could get folks skills to make them more employable.

570
00:48:30,382 --> 00:48:36,927
Leon Noel: 100 Devs started as a way of getting 100 folks into software engineering jobs.

571
00:48:37,327 --> 00:48:38,869
Leon Noel: We're way beyond that now.

572
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:46,235
Leon Noel: And I wanted to make a live cohort where we would meet twice a week on the internet.

573
00:48:46,756 --> 00:48:50,559
Leon Noel: And I really thought it would be, like you said, just a handful of folks, maybe 5, 10 people.

574
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,522
Leon Noel: We did a pilot that was really successful.

575
00:48:53,962 --> 00:48:57,465
Leon Noel: Our first cohort was about 300 people every single class.

576
00:48:58,527 --> 00:48:59,167
Leon Noel: That was successful.

577
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:04,109
Leon Noel: We did another cohort that was like 3,000 people every single live, every single class.

578
00:49:04,489 --> 00:49:05,890
Leon Noel: And so we kind of just built slowly.

579
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:11,552
Leon Noel: We were able to kind of jump from zero to 300, 300 to 3,000.

580
00:49:11,552 --> 00:49:14,093
Leon Noel: And we always joke that we're baddies.

581
00:49:14,553 --> 00:49:16,014
Leon Noel: Like we're baddies writing bad code.

582
00:49:16,034 --> 00:49:16,834
Leon Noel: Like it doesn't matter.

583
00:49:17,575 --> 00:49:19,435
Leon Noel: It's about getting the skills that we need.

584
00:49:19,475 --> 00:49:21,576
Leon Noel: It's about figuring out things on the fly.

585
00:49:21,596 --> 00:49:25,718
Leon Noel: And we just live up to being kind always to ourselves, to others.

586
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:27,979
Leon Noel: And as long as you're willing to say, you know what?

587
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:36,365
Leon Noel: we gotta figure this out, we gotta figure out how do we do this at scale, how do we have 3,000 people live in a class getting help and not feeling lost.

588
00:49:37,146 --> 00:49:44,031
Leon Noel: We had to figure systems and ways of doing that and building community that wanted to support that number of folks.

589
00:49:44,964 --> 00:49:45,244
Quincy Larson: Awesome.

590
00:49:45,545 --> 00:49:48,648
Quincy Larson: What you said there, first of all, I just want to call it that particular insight.

591
00:49:48,668 --> 00:49:50,210
Quincy Larson: We're baddies writing bad code.

592
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:50,891
Quincy Larson: It doesn't matter.

593
00:49:51,371 --> 00:50:02,544
Quincy Larson: So when I was a teenager, really interested in writing and reading lots of fiction and literary journalism and stuff like that.

594
00:50:04,565 --> 00:50:07,086
Quincy Larson: I would always hang out at Denny's like till 2 a.m.

595
00:50:07,126 --> 00:50:09,968
Quincy Larson: just talking to random people and learning from them and just writing and stuff.

596
00:50:10,588 --> 00:50:15,671
Quincy Larson: And one time like our server, he was kind of a grizzled looking dude.

597
00:50:15,811 --> 00:50:23,815
Quincy Larson: Like he would not look at a place in like a bullpen in a newspaper newsroom, if such things even exist in 2024.

598
00:50:23,815 --> 00:50:27,459
Quincy Larson: But his advice to me, I'll never forget what he said.

599
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:32,064
Quincy Larson: He said, throw away your first million words.

600
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:36,870
Leon Noel: And I was like, damn, a million words.

601
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:38,111
Quincy Larson: That's like years of writing.

602
00:50:39,072 --> 00:50:41,794
Quincy Larson: But just accept that it's gonna suck.

603
00:50:42,275 --> 00:50:47,319
Quincy Larson: And the same thing with your code projects, and really the same with any endeavor you take.

604
00:50:47,819 --> 00:50:55,064
Quincy Larson: I've been trying to get better at base for the past three or four years, and it takes me forever to record the base intros.

605
00:50:57,006 --> 00:50:59,328
Leon Noel: One of the videos I watched, you did it and then sat down.

606
00:50:59,348 --> 00:51:02,510
Leon Noel: So I'm telling you that's what I was expecting for today.

607
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:06,853
Leon Noel: So I'm a little sad that I didn't get the base intro live just for me.

608
00:51:07,774 --> 00:51:11,036
Quincy Larson: I didn't want to bother you with like watching me screw it up several times.

609
00:51:11,697 --> 00:51:12,477
Leon Noel: Yeah, I love it.

610
00:51:12,517 --> 00:51:22,864
Quincy Larson: But but yeah, like you just have to accept that the first few thousand hours you spend with an instrument or with like a programming language or with anything is going to be not ready for prime time.

611
00:51:23,644 --> 00:51:26,406
Quincy Larson: You know, my wife, she grew up in China.

612
00:51:26,426 --> 00:51:28,807
Quincy Larson: We met in grad school and she's now a U.S.

613
00:51:28,847 --> 00:51:29,248
Quincy Larson: citizen.

614
00:51:29,288 --> 00:51:32,270
Quincy Larson: We brought her over and naturalized her after grad school.

615
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:39,253
Quincy Larson: After we got married, we've been married 19 years and she loved playing piano, right?

616
00:51:39,393 --> 00:51:54,138
Quincy Larson: And one of the things that she says in China, people take piano extremely seriously, and they have this saying in Chinese, which is basically, you spend thousands of hours behind the stage practicing for five minutes on the stage.

617
00:51:54,499 --> 00:51:56,479
Quincy Larson: That's just the nature of the game.

618
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:25,754
Quincy Larson: And with code, if you're writing some serious system that's gonna, code that's gonna be run millions of times, If you're making an open source contribution to FreeCodeCamp's code base, and it's in the platform itself, and this component is going to be rendered 50,000 times a day or something like that, it's okay that it took you a whole lot of work to get that code into the shape, and it's okay that it took a lot of practice and trial and error before you got the skills to be able to create that code.

619
00:52:26,154 --> 00:52:27,215
Quincy Larson: That code is just going to keep going.

620
00:52:28,135 --> 00:52:38,223
Quincy Larson: you know, uh, when Elvis goes up on the stage and he's being filmed, uh, and he's playing, I use Elvis because I love Elvis.

621
00:52:38,243 --> 00:52:40,745
Quincy Larson: I'm sure he's overrated or whatever, but he's, he's the man.

622
00:52:41,126 --> 00:52:44,989
Quincy Larson: So, I mean, like that guy practiced like crazy.

623
00:52:45,369 --> 00:52:51,694
Quincy Larson: That's definitely the same with, uh, for example, like James Jamerson, the greatest bassist of all time, basically.

624
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:57,360
Quincy Larson: Uh, or, um, You know, like pretty much any musician, they're going to practice like crazy.

625
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:00,783
Quincy Larson: They're going to rehearse obsessively and they're not going to be satisfied.

626
00:53:00,983 --> 00:53:10,613
Quincy Larson: But once that recording is made, once that record is cut, if you there's a great documentary about Thelonious Monk, the jazz pianist.

627
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:11,274
Quincy Larson: Right.

628
00:53:11,434 --> 00:53:13,456
Quincy Larson: And he would only do like two takes.

629
00:53:14,757 --> 00:53:16,599
Quincy Larson: And he's just like after two takes.

630
00:53:16,699 --> 00:53:18,100
Quincy Larson: whatever I do is gonna be garbage.

631
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:20,302
Quincy Larson: I'm done like use one of those takes.

632
00:53:20,342 --> 00:53:25,686
Quincy Larson: but how we got how he got so good that he could actually Nail it in one or two takes.

633
00:53:26,047 --> 00:53:35,895
Quincy Larson: was he practiced like a maniac and he spent so much time at the piano Where a lot of you know, I guess amateurs would just be like good enough.

634
00:53:36,275 --> 00:53:50,306
Quincy Larson: He was not done with that and so I feel the same way about like any undertaking, but certainly with coding, it may seem like coding is not like a synchronous performative event, like where you're having to sit down and perform in that regard.

635
00:53:50,346 --> 00:53:51,647
Quincy Larson: You can go and you can edit your code.

636
00:53:51,667 --> 00:53:52,448
Quincy Larson: You can iterate on it.

637
00:53:52,508 --> 00:53:53,769
Quincy Larson: The tools have gotten so much better.

638
00:53:54,249 --> 00:54:02,175
Quincy Larson: Like Free Code Camp, every millisecond or two, you're going to get the tests telling you whether you've met all the test conditions or whether you need to keep tweaking your code, right?

639
00:54:02,555 --> 00:54:08,210
Quincy Larson: So you have all these tools to iterate, but at the end of the day, you should still try to approach it like a performance.

640
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:12,152
Quincy Larson: You'll get a lot better if you don't rely so much on the tools catching what you're doing.

641
00:54:12,192 --> 00:54:18,254
Quincy Larson: But anyway, I'm kind of going on a tangent, but I just wanted to riff on the insight that it is.

642
00:54:18,294 --> 00:54:18,994
Quincy Larson: We're all baddies.

643
00:54:19,695 --> 00:54:20,895
Quincy Larson: We're writing bad code.

644
00:54:20,955 --> 00:54:23,556
Quincy Larson: It doesn't matter, because you throw away your first million words.

645
00:54:24,057 --> 00:54:28,699
Quincy Larson: You spent thousands of hours at the piano before you're playing anything that's worth anybody listening to.

646
00:54:28,719 --> 00:54:32,120
Quincy Larson: You just have to accept that this is the nature of reality.

647
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:33,801
Quincy Larson: This is the nature of doing anything that's hard.

648
00:54:34,947 --> 00:54:36,509
Quincy Larson: is it's going to be hard.

649
00:54:36,689 --> 00:54:42,174
Quincy Larson: You're going to have to work hard and you have to just have that mental fortitude and that's something that comes through in your.

650
00:54:42,294 --> 00:54:44,236
Quincy Larson: your video is like it's so supportive.

651
00:54:44,836 --> 00:54:44,977
Quincy Larson: Like.

652
00:54:45,037 --> 00:54:47,399
Quincy Larson: I love the way that you're just like it's all good.

653
00:54:47,539 --> 00:54:49,120
Quincy Larson: Like just this happens to everybody.

654
00:54:49,161 --> 00:54:50,242
Quincy Larson: Everybody has to go through this.

655
00:54:51,738 --> 00:55:02,125
Quincy Larson: I always like to say, some people may be slightly better at programming aptitude-wise, or they may have some intrinsic quirk that makes them marginally better at programming.

656
00:55:02,646 --> 00:55:07,389
Quincy Larson: But those people have probably just forgotten how much time they spent at the keyboard when they were a kid.

657
00:55:07,409 --> 00:55:09,330
Quincy Larson: They were privileged enough to grow up with computers.

658
00:55:09,771 --> 00:55:16,716
Quincy Larson: When you hear Bill Gates talk about how, oh, I don't actually write out the code until I've figured everything out in my head.

659
00:55:16,736 --> 00:55:18,377
Quincy Larson: And then I said, that's nonsense.

660
00:55:19,403 --> 00:55:24,968
Quincy Larson: Bill Gates does not just sit down and like write basic from memory because he'd like been moving everything around his head.

661
00:55:25,068 --> 00:55:25,768
Quincy Larson: People can't do that.

662
00:55:25,828 --> 00:55:26,449
Quincy Larson: I don't believe that.

663
00:55:26,509 --> 00:55:31,853
Quincy Larson: Maybe there are some people that have like some extreme form of like, like extreme brains.

664
00:55:32,154 --> 00:55:35,236
Quincy Larson: They could do something like that, but I don't believe that Bill Gates could do that sort of stuff.

665
00:55:35,296 --> 00:55:36,738
Quincy Larson: I think he's just talking up the mythos.

666
00:55:37,358 --> 00:55:39,420
Quincy Larson: You know, he's trying to build up hype for himself.

667
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:46,065
Quincy Larson: And like it's this old kind of like old school elitism that a lot of the early devs, the old guard have.

668
00:55:46,245 --> 00:55:49,227
Quincy Larson: And just don't buy that hype is all I want to say.

669
00:55:49,287 --> 00:55:53,611
Quincy Larson: And I want to thank you for like dispelling a lot of that, whether you're intentionally dispelling it or not.

670
00:55:53,691 --> 00:55:57,113
Quincy Larson: Just telling people like coding is hard, right?

671
00:55:57,173 --> 00:55:58,835
Quincy Larson: Like not sugarcoating it.

672
00:55:59,546 --> 00:56:03,889
Leon Noel: We call it the trough of sorrow which actually comes from like startup worlds is one of the things.

673
00:56:03,909 --> 00:56:29,422
Leon Noel: there's this very classic graph of like Just like really big hill that you go up when you're really excited about something like yeah I'm gonna learn the code on you buy a thousand demi courses cuz buying stuff feels good even though you're not gonna do them and at the very top and then you start like day one of any actual coding program and then you just plummet once you realize how long it's going to take and then you spend all that time going through the trough of sorrow.

674
00:56:29,802 --> 00:56:38,944
Leon Noel: and then the most like sick thing about this is that I shouldn't say that but the most twisted thing about this is at the very end there's an even further dip that you have to go through.

675
00:56:38,964 --> 00:56:42,825
Leon Noel: yeah where you it's the and then you get into what they call the wiggles of false hope.

676
00:56:42,845 --> 00:56:45,366
Leon Noel: so even after you've gone through you've learned everything you needed to learn.

677
00:56:45,766 --> 00:56:49,588
Leon Noel: you start actually interviewing to get the job and you're just getting rejected, rejected, rejected.

678
00:56:49,648 --> 00:56:57,111
Leon Noel: And so there's just this huge curve, long trough of sorrow that for a lot of folks takes years to get through.

679
00:56:57,131 --> 00:57:03,954
Leon Noel: Then once you get to the end where you're like trying to actually get something out of it, it gets even worse and then slowly, slowly gets better.

680
00:57:04,054 --> 00:57:11,157
Leon Noel: So I think the big thing for what we do, like you mentioned at 100Devs is just helping folks manage that frustration.

681
00:57:11,937 --> 00:57:14,799
Leon Noel: We kind of have like three key things that we just say every class almost.

682
00:57:14,919 --> 00:57:18,342
Leon Noel: Manage your frustration, be consistent, and take care of yourself.

683
00:57:18,882 --> 00:57:30,050
Leon Noel: When you look at how adults learn, the reason why adults kind of probably don't learn as well as they think they could is because they don't manage that frustration piece.

684
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:33,753
Leon Noel: When they look at Language fluency and like language acquisition.

685
00:57:33,773 --> 00:57:40,334
Leon Noel: Yeah, they thought that we probably lost the ability to be fluent in our teenage years But they found that that probably isn't true.

686
00:57:40,375 --> 00:57:49,876
Leon Noel: It's just once you get out of those years your time is entirely your own and so would you rather do this thing that sucks for two years or would you actually Sit down and do it.

687
00:57:49,896 --> 00:57:54,737
Leon Noel: And so yeah folks that can manage that frustration to actually be get through the things they want to do.

688
00:57:55,177 --> 00:57:57,977
Leon Noel: And so that's a big part and it's also why we're live.

689
00:57:58,958 --> 00:58:02,691
Leon Noel: when you look at other programs.

690
00:58:02,831 --> 00:58:04,292
Leon Noel: I love Dr.

691
00:58:04,312 --> 00:58:05,872
Leon Noel: Malan out of Harvard, CS50.

692
00:58:06,013 --> 00:58:07,273
Leon Noel: I love that.

693
00:58:07,473 --> 00:58:09,214
Leon Noel: CS50 is now on FreeCodeCamp.

694
00:58:09,534 --> 00:58:11,754
Leon Noel: I read every single article they've ever put out.

695
00:58:12,215 --> 00:58:19,537
Leon Noel: And one of the ones that are really interesting is they actually published all of their data for CS50 in the beginning, which was really cool to read through.

696
00:58:19,557 --> 00:58:27,212
Leon Noel: And you notice that They had like 150,000 people that signed up for like the first run of the course.

697
00:58:27,812 --> 00:58:34,014
Leon Noel: They said like 100,000 people that engaged, but only like 1% completed it, right?

698
00:58:34,534 --> 00:58:45,457
Leon Noel: And so that was something that really kind of stuck in my brain because when you looked at the like in-person program, like the live in-person program, it was like 99% completion.

699
00:58:47,037 --> 00:59:02,598
Leon Noel: So there's something there, and I think being live, being with a cohort of other individuals, being with real people, being with community can help you ease that frustration, get help when you need it, and be a little bit more consistent and actually get to the end.

700
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:04,687
Quincy Larson: Yeah, absolutely.

701
00:59:04,907 --> 00:59:10,750
Quincy Larson: There's positive peer pressure, essentially, of having your peers go into it with you.

702
00:59:10,770 --> 00:59:14,392
Quincy Larson: That's the beauty of cohorted models, that it's difficult to reproduce.

703
00:59:14,432 --> 00:59:23,137
Quincy Larson: But if you can reproduce it, like Leon Noel has, then bam, you've got like... lighting in a bottle, like you've got people who are going to have each other's backs.

704
00:59:23,797 --> 00:59:27,600
Quincy Larson: And like when you're down, they're up and they'll help you get back up.

705
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:27,880
Quincy Larson: Right.

706
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,100
Quincy Larson: So you help one another.

707
00:59:29,781 --> 00:59:32,622
Quincy Larson: So that's kind of the genius of 100 devs.

708
00:59:32,762 --> 00:59:34,483
Quincy Larson: Maybe you can talk a little about the mechanics of it.

709
00:59:34,523 --> 00:59:40,346
Quincy Larson: Obviously, you've got the discord, you've got the twice weekly streams when classes in session, so to speak.

710
00:59:41,407 --> 00:59:42,167
Quincy Larson: And they are.

711
00:59:43,368 --> 00:59:44,629
Quincy Larson: high energy streams, man.

712
00:59:44,669 --> 00:59:45,889
Quincy Larson: I just have to comment like that.

713
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:50,190
Quincy Larson: You got like the like the cool astronaut background.

714
00:59:50,571 --> 00:59:57,813
Quincy Larson: It's like watching like a gamer on Twitch, like like watching somebody play and like, you know, see us go at a high level or something.

715
00:59:57,833 --> 00:59:59,354
Quincy Larson: But it's education, right?

716
00:59:59,414 --> 01:00:04,896
Quincy Larson: Like in my mind, like you're pioneering kind of a new approach to education that is.

717
01:00:05,896 --> 01:00:15,587
Quincy Larson: based off of like people are already familiar with like games and anime and all the other cultural kind of touchstones and you're just like hey let's let's relate this to software engineering.

718
01:00:15,767 --> 01:00:18,390
Quincy Larson: right and so you're doing a great job of that.

719
01:00:18,430 --> 01:00:23,276
Quincy Larson: but maybe you can talk about in addition to the stream in addition to the discord what are the other aspects of 100 devs?

720
01:00:23,296 --> 01:00:25,358
Quincy Larson: what are the other instruments?

721
01:00:26,115 --> 01:00:26,355
Leon Noel: Sure.

722
01:00:26,435 --> 01:00:29,717
Leon Noel: So we do a live cohort model.

723
01:00:29,737 --> 01:00:31,357
Leon Noel: We basically do a cohort a year.

724
01:00:32,338 --> 01:00:39,661
Leon Noel: And when that cohort is live, we're live on Twitch twice a week for about three hours for a class.

725
01:00:40,241 --> 01:00:45,524
Leon Noel: We take about an hour to do review, spaced repetition, active recall is super important.

726
01:00:46,404 --> 01:00:50,926
Leon Noel: So we spend that first hour just like reviewing, and then about two hours of something new, we do that twice a week.

727
01:00:51,326 --> 01:00:57,389
Leon Noel: And then we have office hours on Sunday, which is another stream, typically on Twitch or on Discord.

728
01:00:57,409 --> 01:01:01,391
Leon Noel: But it's just people asking questions and getting things answered.

729
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:06,994
Leon Noel: Outside of that, there are so many other expectations and things that you're working on.

730
01:01:07,034 --> 01:01:10,717
Leon Noel: that's about 10 to 20 hours outside of that twice a week class.

731
01:01:11,197 --> 01:01:14,260
Leon Noel: Networking, all the things that are going to actually move the needle for you to get a job.

732
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:18,623
Leon Noel: Our joke is that we're not really a coding program, we're a getting a job program.

733
01:01:18,663 --> 01:01:22,767
Leon Noel: And so all the things we get to be doing to get a job have to be happening when we're not live.

734
01:01:23,467 --> 01:01:33,989
Leon Noel: Then for folks that can't participate in a live experience, we have our illustrious catch up crew, which is a group of folks that are working through the classes at maybe a little bit more of their own pace.

735
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:38,351
Leon Noel: We have a lot of folks that are around the world that can't make that live time work for them.

736
01:01:38,731 --> 01:01:42,151
Leon Noel: So they get together, they're on our discord working through the classes together.

737
01:01:42,411 --> 01:01:52,936
Leon Noel: You'll often see like 20 people just in a voice channel watching a class together that they've just, they've, Come together to do and so you can move through the material at your own pace.

738
01:01:53,616 --> 01:02:01,161
Leon Noel: when we're outside of a cohort like right now We have we have our huddles twice a week and the huddles are just like a traditional stand-up.

739
01:02:01,181 --> 01:02:03,083
Leon Noel: We're just trying to move away from that.

740
01:02:03,403 --> 01:02:04,924
Leon Noel: I think it's a slightly ableist term.

741
01:02:04,964 --> 01:02:06,665
Leon Noel: So we introduce them as huddles

742
01:02:07,346 --> 01:02:10,128
Quincy Larson: and yeah, I never thought about stand-up as an ableist term,

743
01:02:10,468 --> 01:02:10,788
Leon Noel: but it

744
01:02:10,808 --> 01:02:12,169
Quincy Larson: is a lot of people can't stand up

745
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:28,211
Leon Noel: and so we We'll have anywhere from like 500 to 700 people every huddle, just asking questions, sharing, we call the job hunt, the hunt, sharing what's happening on the hunt, how they are negotiating.

746
01:02:28,271 --> 01:02:30,493
Leon Noel: They'll come up live, we'll help them negotiate offers.

747
01:02:30,933 --> 01:02:35,197
Leon Noel: They'll talk about an interview that went great or poorly.

748
01:02:35,597 --> 01:02:51,200
Leon Noel: And just by showing up to these huddles, you're learning all these, like, it's so hard to go through life with everything that you're experiencing being the first time you've experienced it, it doesn't have to be that way, specifically when you have a community that's also doing it.

749
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:59,488
Leon Noel: So the huddles are our way to expose people to the realities of getting a job, going and interviewing and actually seeing all this knowledge.

750
01:02:59,508 --> 01:03:02,792
Leon Noel: And so that when you're in that situation, you can experience it too.

751
01:03:04,053 --> 01:03:08,755
Leon Noel: We have the huddles twice a week, and then we have a lot of independently generated community things.

752
01:03:08,835 --> 01:03:17,778
Leon Noel: So we have Banky Brunch, shout out Banky Brunch, which is a group of folks that come together to work through behavioral questions, technical questions pretty much every single day.

753
01:03:18,418 --> 01:03:21,639
Leon Noel: We have groups that are working on projects, our voice channels are always going.

754
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:27,765
Leon Noel: None of this works without community and a wonderful group of mods.

755
01:03:28,225 --> 01:03:41,779
Leon Noel: I'd be remiss to not say Miriam, Diviker, MayanWolf, Claire, these folks that make all this work and for free and volunteering so much of their life to make this happen.

756
01:03:42,717 --> 01:03:45,720
Quincy Larson: amazing yeah like free code camp.

757
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:50,785
Quincy Larson: similarly to draw parallels to our organization very community driven like.

758
01:03:51,225 --> 01:03:56,651
Quincy Larson: we have tons of mods on the forum on discord and we have open source contributors that are just dropping in.

759
01:03:56,711 --> 01:04:02,797
Quincy Larson: and like fixing little bugs making sure that like our copy is as readable as possible to non-native english speakers.

760
01:04:03,157 --> 01:04:23,976
Quincy Larson: making sure that like It's a lot of contributor driven activity and it sounds like you've figured out a way to encourage a lot of people in your community, empower them with like, you know, you can delegate some degree of, I guess, authority to them so that they can go out and they can just experiment and build out different things.

761
01:04:25,097 --> 01:04:33,582
Quincy Larson: One of the things that you said that I thought was really interesting, I do want to talk about, let's talk about spaced repetition and active recall, I believe are the terms.

762
01:04:34,523 --> 01:04:43,929
Quincy Larson: Barbara Oakley teaches the learn course, the most popular MOOC, massive open online course ever, other than maybe like CS50, which we were talking about earlier.

763
01:04:45,229 --> 01:04:48,852
Quincy Larson: Learning how to learn, it's not just obvious how to learn their tactics.

764
01:04:49,312 --> 01:04:49,512
Quincy Larson: Right?

765
01:04:49,552 --> 01:05:05,588
Quincy Larson: There are phenomena that are ingrained in the human brain from evolution, from the savannas of Africa, basically, that we carry with us today, that we can use if we know how to use them.

766
01:05:05,628 --> 01:05:07,710
Quincy Larson: And one of them, you mentioned, is space repetition.

767
01:05:08,111 --> 01:05:09,152
Quincy Larson: What is space repetition?

768
01:05:09,892 --> 01:05:10,653
Leon Noel: Yeah, sure.

769
01:05:10,793 --> 01:05:17,077
Leon Noel: So I guess kind of to set the stage real quick is that a lot of folks that attempt to learn how to code are not successful.

770
01:05:17,597 --> 01:05:20,759
Leon Noel: We know that, we know the drop-offs, we know that that's just a reality.

771
01:05:21,399 --> 01:05:27,803
Leon Noel: And a lot of time those people feel like that it is them, that it's a, they, they do not have the ability to learn how to code.

772
01:05:27,863 --> 01:05:32,466
Leon Noel: They do not have, there's something about them that would stop them from being successful as a software engineer.

773
01:05:33,166 --> 01:05:38,672
Leon Noel: And as someone that's worked with thousands of people, like literally in the classroom, my finger is on their keyboard.

774
01:05:39,132 --> 01:05:45,599
Leon Noel: I just know fundamentally my heart of hearts, like outside of a cognitive impairment.

775
01:05:45,639 --> 01:05:46,900
Leon Noel: that's just not true.

776
01:05:47,421 --> 01:05:53,847
Leon Noel: And the thing that I found is it's just that most people don't know how to learn.

777
01:05:54,908 --> 01:06:07,512
Leon Noel: And it's almost criminal that our school system doesn't actually teach us how to learn, that every textbook doesn't have some very fundamental things at the beginning that help you remember and learn this material.

778
01:06:07,972 --> 01:06:11,693
Leon Noel: So the difficult thing about software engineering is that it's a cumulative career.

779
01:06:11,753 --> 01:06:15,254
Leon Noel: The things you learn this week, you might need two years from now.

780
01:06:15,874 --> 01:06:21,706
Leon Noel: And so there are two really fundamental learning techniques that Dr.

781
01:06:21,726 --> 01:06:22,908
Leon Noel: Barbara Oakley does walk through.

782
01:06:22,928 --> 01:06:25,090
Leon Noel: that I really it's my favorite one of my favorite courses of all time.

783
01:06:25,651 --> 01:06:29,495
Leon Noel: that brings up where as humans.

784
01:06:30,774 --> 01:06:32,655
Leon Noel: we forget stuff very quickly.

785
01:06:33,436 --> 01:06:52,490
Leon Noel: So if I gave you a three-letter code, this is called the Evan-Haas curve, it was a study of one, it's somewhat been replicated since then, but basically this person just tracked a new three-letter word, a three-letter code every day, and they found within the first like 30 minutes, there was a 20% chance they'd just forgotten it.

786
01:06:53,069 --> 01:06:54,290
Leon Noel: the first 30 minutes.

787
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:57,631
Leon Noel: So imagine trying to learn this really complicated coding stuff.

788
01:06:58,232 --> 01:06:59,993
Leon Noel: And within the first 30 minutes, you're going to forget it.

789
01:07:00,513 --> 01:07:07,196
Leon Noel: Then if you look at that forgetting curve by the end of the month, there's an 80% chance that you've forgotten that very simple thing.

790
01:07:07,216 --> 01:07:13,840
Leon Noel: And so For a lot of folks that are going into coding education, they just don't realize that the forgetting curve is very steep.

791
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:19,843
Leon Noel: They'll learn something, a month later, they've completely forgotten it, and they have to start back over, and that's super frustrating.

792
01:07:20,344 --> 01:07:27,628
Leon Noel: So spaced repetition is using a tool that makes the material come back to you when you need it most.

793
01:07:28,228 --> 01:07:32,410
Leon Noel: And so a typical tool for this is Anki or Anki, however you want to call it.

794
01:07:32,430 --> 01:07:35,872
Quincy Larson: Yeah, Anki, it means to commit to memory in Japanese.

795
01:07:35,892 --> 01:07:35,992
Quincy Larson: Yeah.

796
01:07:36,032 --> 01:07:36,493
Quincy Larson: Anki suru.

797
01:07:37,253 --> 01:07:37,813
Leon Noel: Exactly.

798
01:07:38,213 --> 01:07:45,875
Leon Noel: And so it is a flashcard tool that has an algorithm behind it, so that surfaces the information when you need to see it.

799
01:07:45,935 --> 01:07:57,837
Leon Noel: So if you're doing good study habits, which is a huge portion of what we teach at 100Devs, it's just like how to study, you're using this tool so that the things you learned about HTML, you're not forgetting when we're talking about like MongoDB, right?

800
01:07:57,897 --> 01:08:03,958
Leon Noel: And so that spaced repetition is going to help you remember stuff for the long haul, which is really important for a cumulative career.

801
01:08:04,558 --> 01:08:10,221
Leon Noel: But then the other thing that's even more important, in my opinion, than spatial repetition is something called active recall.

802
01:08:12,002 --> 01:08:21,987
Leon Noel: Coding can be done through video tutorials, it can be done through text, but it's a lot of information to process, and most people just go through it.

803
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:25,040
Leon Noel: that's not active learning.

804
01:08:25,479 --> 01:08:34,982
Leon Noel: They feel maybe some sort of productivity from having watched a tutorial or having read a blog post, but they didn't actually engage with that material or learn.

805
01:08:35,323 --> 01:08:38,243
Leon Noel: And a lot of times, like for me, I teleport through information.

806
01:08:38,263 --> 01:08:42,743
Leon Noel: Like if I'm reading a book, I'll get through three paragraphs and I'm like, what the heck just happened?

807
01:08:42,764 --> 01:08:45,145
Leon Noel: I feel like I've just teleported through that.

808
01:08:45,165 --> 01:08:55,327
Quincy Larson: I haven't heard that expression, but that's a good way to describe the phenomenon, especially, you know, people who have like ADHD and stuff, they may just be like, halfway through a book, maybe.

809
01:08:56,768 --> 01:08:58,087
Quincy Larson: Your mind wanders.

810
01:08:58,787 --> 01:09:03,910
Quincy Larson: And if you're not constantly trying to engage with it, you won't necessarily retain it.

811
01:09:03,930 --> 01:09:08,892
Leon Noel: So active recall is the way that helps me as someone that does have ADHD do this.

812
01:09:08,971 --> 01:09:14,234
Leon Noel: And so active recall is just recalling the things that you just learned or just read or just watched.

813
01:09:14,854 --> 01:09:18,935
Leon Noel: And for folks that do have attention issues, I recommend doing that after each paragraph.

814
01:09:20,417 --> 01:09:22,318
Leon Noel: I recommend doing it after each chapter end.

815
01:09:22,899 --> 01:09:26,020
Leon Noel: And you're just literally talking to yourself, what did I just read?

816
01:09:26,041 --> 01:09:27,002
Leon Noel: What did I just learn?

817
01:09:27,022 --> 01:09:28,263
Leon Noel: And you're saying it out loud.

818
01:09:28,743 --> 01:09:32,527
Leon Noel: The research behind it is really shocking, like staggering differences.

819
01:09:33,228 --> 01:09:39,752
Leon Noel: You can learn something once, actively recall it once, and do better than somebody that reread it four times.

820
01:09:40,314 --> 01:09:40,474
Quincy Larson: Yeah.

821
01:09:41,107 --> 01:09:45,609
Leon Noel: Like you can do a quarter of the effort and have better results just with this one technique.

822
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:50,372
Leon Noel: And the fact that that's not like stamped in every single textbook ever made is absurd.

823
01:09:50,732 --> 01:09:55,655
Quincy Larson: Yeah, it's, I mean, like we could talk all day about like the shortcomings of the U.S.

824
01:09:56,155 --> 01:09:59,477
Quincy Larson: education system, like both K through 12 and higher ed.

825
01:09:59,517 --> 01:10:05,761
Quincy Larson: And to be completely clear, there are a lot of very smart people who are working very hard to address a lot of these deficiencies.

826
01:10:06,451 --> 01:10:15,636
Quincy Larson: But the fact that we're having to explain what active recall and space repetition are when they're time-tested phenomena that you can leverage.

827
01:10:16,137 --> 01:10:18,438
Quincy Larson: So just a quick note about active recall.

828
01:10:18,458 --> 01:10:22,100
Quincy Larson: This is one of the reasons why Free Code Camp's entire curriculum is interactive.

829
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,561
Quincy Larson: It's because you have to grapple with things.

830
01:10:24,862 --> 01:10:28,043
Quincy Larson: Otherwise, it could have just blown right past you, right?

831
01:10:28,644 --> 01:10:32,046
Quincy Larson: Everything needs some sort of evaluation criteria, some sort of comprehension check.

832
01:10:32,706 --> 01:10:41,889
Quincy Larson: And if you're doing something that doesn't have comprehensive check, if there's not some right or wrong answer, taking a moment to summarize what you just learned or relate it to something else you've learned, thinking about

833
01:10:41,929 --> 01:10:42,949
Leon Noel: it, just grappling with it,

834
01:10:43,429 --> 01:10:48,371
Quincy Larson: that can absolutely help cement those, you know, synapses, right?

835
01:10:49,211 --> 01:10:53,712
Quincy Larson: What's the thing that connects synapse axioms, not axioms, dendrites?

836
01:10:53,732 --> 01:10:54,873
Quincy Larson: I can't remember.

837
01:10:55,393 --> 01:10:55,873
Quincy Larson: Sorry.

838
01:10:56,353 --> 01:10:57,153
Quincy Larson: You probably know.

839
01:10:57,313 --> 01:11:01,849
Quincy Larson: But yeah, like, And it's something anybody can do.

840
01:11:02,049 --> 01:11:06,031
Quincy Larson: When I'm reading a news article or something like that, that's not interactive.

841
01:11:06,071 --> 01:11:11,373
Quincy Larson: Now with GPT or something, I can throw it in GPT and say, hey, come up with a multiple choice question based off this article.

842
01:11:11,413 --> 01:11:12,254
Quincy Larson: And I'll do that sometimes.

843
01:11:14,234 --> 01:11:17,216
Quincy Larson: Not just for active recall, but spaced repetition.

844
01:11:17,916 --> 01:11:20,177
Quincy Larson: write a bunch of notes, and then review them a few days later.

845
01:11:20,277 --> 01:11:25,460
Quincy Larson: Or use a tool like Anki that can systematically do that, where you can like load a bunch of flashcards.

846
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:29,182
Quincy Larson: A lot of learning platforms have spaced repetition just built into them.

847
01:11:29,222 --> 01:11:37,806
Quincy Larson: If you go through the Free Code Camp curriculum, it's designed in such a way that we're going to reintroduce concepts over and over, and you're going to be like, oh yeah, I kind of remember this from like

848
01:11:38,286 --> 01:11:38,486
Leon Noel: A few

849
01:11:38,526 --> 01:11:45,073
Quincy Larson: hours ago, you know, it was like, or a few days ago, like, but but we're intentionally trying to, you know, incorporate that.

850
01:11:45,133 --> 01:11:53,001
Quincy Larson: And one of the things I think talking about the free cocaine curriculum, let's talk about 100 devs and like what you all are, is it 100 devs or 100 devs?

851
01:11:55,154 --> 01:11:57,397
Leon Noel: I can say either 100 devs.

852
01:11:57,397 --> 01:11:59,940
Quincy Larson: 100 devs is shorter.

853
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:00,200
Quincy Larson: Yeah.

854
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:00,620
Quincy Larson: Yeah.

855
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,823
Quincy Larson: That's more, uh, more like easy to say.

856
01:12:03,123 --> 01:12:07,268
Quincy Larson: So with 100 devs, like what is the coursework that you're going through?

857
01:12:07,308 --> 01:12:08,569
Quincy Larson: Like, are you, are you using MOOCs?

858
01:12:08,630 --> 01:12:10,211
Quincy Larson: Are you using open textbooks?

859
01:12:10,251 --> 01:12:12,114
Quincy Larson: Are you creating a lot of the stuff yourself?

860
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:12,834
Leon Noel: Yeah.

861
01:12:12,914 --> 01:12:14,797
Leon Noel: So I think there's like two important things.

862
01:12:15,097 --> 01:12:18,398
Leon Noel: One, I really don't believe the content matters.

863
01:12:20,079 --> 01:12:21,299
Leon Noel: We're a jobs program.

864
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:33,241
Leon Noel: I think one of the biggest mistakes people make is an overinvestment in the idea that the learning aspect and not all the other things that move the needle.

865
01:12:33,541 --> 01:12:35,781
Leon Noel: We're very much two tracks.

866
01:12:35,801 --> 01:12:39,922
Leon Noel: We have all this other stuff we're doing outside of the learning and then the learning as well.

867
01:12:39,962 --> 01:12:41,462
Leon Noel: The learning is very simple.

868
01:12:42,062 --> 01:12:44,243
Leon Noel: We do full stack JavaScript.

869
01:12:45,043 --> 01:12:51,668
Leon Noel: And I do a lot of like custom, like I make all the lectures basically with the slides and all the funny stuff that you mentioned on Twitch.

870
01:12:52,069 --> 01:12:54,090
Leon Noel: And we move through that material together.

871
01:12:54,571 --> 01:12:59,454
Leon Noel: But a lot of it is supplementing with other things that I think are just the best free courses out there.

872
01:12:59,575 --> 01:13:02,617
Leon Noel: So in the beginning, our students will use some free code camp.

873
01:13:03,197 --> 01:13:12,365
Leon Noel: As they get a little bit further along, they'll use some things maybe from full stack open that are trying to supplement the things that we're doing in the classroom.

874
01:13:13,005 --> 01:13:15,966
Leon Noel: And anytime that we're doing something, it's always a free resource.

875
01:13:16,226 --> 01:13:20,388
Leon Noel: It always has a free trial or not trial, like a free level of access.

876
01:13:20,908 --> 01:13:21,849
Leon Noel: Yeah.

877
01:13:21,969 --> 01:13:25,710
Leon Noel: And so we give you the skills to be a full stack web developer.

878
01:13:26,111 --> 01:13:33,134
Leon Noel: We do some of the other kind of rounding out to give you the software engineering skill set, the tooling and things that you might use.

879
01:13:33,174 --> 01:13:37,976
Leon Noel: And then as you're getting ready to go on the hunt, the data structures and algorithms, you're going to need to be successful.

880
01:13:38,576 --> 01:13:40,677
Leon Noel: But that's kind of like the coding stuff.

881
01:13:41,377 --> 01:13:46,979
Leon Noel: Outside of that, from the very beginning, there's pretty stringent requirements in terms of your networking.

882
01:13:47,099 --> 01:13:54,182
Leon Noel: So you are supposed to be getting three connections and two coffee chats every single week throughout program.

883
01:13:54,602 --> 01:13:59,263
Leon Noel: You're doing things that are going to be opening all these doors to help you get a job.

884
01:13:59,603 --> 01:14:01,644
Leon Noel: And that's kind of another.

885
01:14:01,664 --> 01:14:07,946
Leon Noel: really, I think that's where our curriculum shines is those things that are really helpful and impactful for helping you get a job.

886
01:14:07,966 --> 01:14:11,087
Leon Noel: We actually have a lot of folks that do other boot camps, which we love.

887
01:14:11,827 --> 01:14:16,048
Leon Noel: I don't really care where you come from, what you do, as long as you're getting to where you want to go.

888
01:14:16,768 --> 01:14:21,710
Leon Noel: And a lot of folks will join us just for the how to get a job portion, which I think we're pretty strong at.

889
01:14:22,210 --> 01:14:22,470
Quincy Larson: Awesome.

890
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:31,896
Quincy Larson: So it's so interesting and important that you distinguish yourself as not a learn coding program, but a get a job program.

891
01:14:32,756 --> 01:14:47,626
Quincy Larson: And I just want to emphasize, even though we put a great deal of time and energy into our curriculum, it's absolutely like if you look at where all the donations we get and things like that go toward, it's instructional design, platform development, mainly for the core curriculum.

892
01:14:48,787 --> 01:14:56,495
Quincy Larson: Because for us it is important that there's a really good core curriculum, but I'll be the first to tell you or I guess the second since Leon just said it.

893
01:14:58,356 --> 01:15:02,079
Quincy Larson: Getting a job as a developer is really three things, in my humble opinion.

894
01:15:02,519 --> 01:15:10,624
Quincy Larson: And if you haven't read my free book that I published about a year ago, Learn to Code and Get a Developer Job, literally the name of the book.

895
01:15:10,864 --> 01:15:16,648
Quincy Larson: Just Google that, or Google code book, or learn to code book, I think you should find it pretty quickly.

896
01:15:17,769 --> 01:15:23,233
Quincy Larson: And by finding it, and clicking on it, and spending a lot of time on the webpage, you help ensure that Google continues to recommend it to other people.

897
01:15:26,684 --> 01:15:28,465
Quincy Larson: Skills are only one leg of the stool.

898
01:15:29,306 --> 01:15:32,108
Quincy Larson: Network and reputation are the other two.

899
01:15:32,348 --> 01:15:35,631
Quincy Larson: And we've talked enough about skills.

900
01:15:35,651 --> 01:15:42,857
Quincy Larson: Let's jump into networking and building your reputation, which are two things that are also instrumental to the 100 Devs program.

901
01:15:44,158 --> 01:15:44,378
Quincy Larson: Yeah.

902
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:44,658
Quincy Larson: Yeah.

903
01:15:44,718 --> 01:15:48,020
Quincy Larson: Like what is the value of a network?

904
01:15:48,121 --> 01:15:53,204
Quincy Larson: Why is networking worth your time and energy when it's such an awkward thing to do?

905
01:15:54,666 --> 01:15:55,666
Leon Noel: Yeah, we have.

906
01:15:58,158 --> 01:16:03,539
Leon Noel: It's just like we have a lot of in jokes and things like that, that if you're not part of the community, it's kind of weird to bring up.

907
01:16:03,599 --> 01:16:05,939
Leon Noel: But we refer to most people as clickers.

908
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:11,420
Leon Noel: People that learn how to code and then they just click apply.

909
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:13,681
Leon Noel: And clickers don't get jobs.

910
01:16:13,881 --> 01:16:18,922
Leon Noel: Maybe every once in a while, somebody gets lucky and they click on a button and they magically get a job.

911
01:16:19,082 --> 01:16:22,262
Leon Noel: But especially in this market, clickers don't get jobs.

912
01:16:22,402 --> 01:16:26,303
Leon Noel: And so we do everything in our power to never click apply.

913
01:16:27,003 --> 01:16:38,292
Leon Noel: We want to make sure that we're talking to like real humans that can see our humanity that can see our ability and our skills and the things that we can do so that we're not just.

914
01:16:39,253 --> 01:16:42,015
Leon Noel: discarded by some AI ATS system.

915
01:16:42,715 --> 01:16:47,919
Leon Noel: And so from the very beginning of 100 devs, we're tasking you with generalized networking.

916
01:16:48,539 --> 01:16:53,683
Leon Noel: And networking, I think it's like a scary term that I don't think should be, to me, networking is just making friends.

917
01:16:54,563 --> 01:16:56,244
Leon Noel: And you want to do things.

918
01:16:56,304 --> 01:16:59,707
Leon Noel: in the beginning that gets you comfortable with making friends.

919
01:17:00,187 --> 01:17:04,150
Leon Noel: And so you don't have to start networking by going to like your local Python meetup.

920
01:17:04,190 --> 01:17:05,651
Leon Noel: that's like super hardcore, like no.

921
01:17:06,491 --> 01:17:10,454
Leon Noel: if you like Pokemon, go play Pokemon at your local league, right?

922
01:17:10,514 --> 01:17:19,540
Leon Noel: Or like, if you like hiking, join like a hiking group and just like share passion with some others, get comfortable talking to people.

923
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:30,066
Leon Noel: And then eventually apply those skills that you learn to places where developers are more likely to hang out and turn those acquaintances into friends.

924
01:17:30,467 --> 01:17:40,331
Leon Noel: And then by the time you're ready to go on the job hunt, you ultimately want hundreds of people that you've interacted with over the past year that you could go to and say, hey, you saw me where I was.

925
01:17:40,431 --> 01:17:41,472
Leon Noel: Here's where I'm at now.

926
01:17:41,893 --> 01:17:42,973
Leon Noel: Who should I talk to?

927
01:17:42,993 --> 01:17:44,175
Leon Noel: I'm looking for a job.

928
01:17:44,515 --> 01:17:46,016
Leon Noel: And that's really successful for people.

929
01:17:46,096 --> 01:17:47,658
Leon Noel: So that's phase one of networking.

930
01:17:47,678 --> 01:17:51,201
Leon Noel: Phase two is once you go on the hunt, it's very targeted.

931
01:17:51,281 --> 01:17:55,684
Leon Noel: We call it building our hit list where we identify the companies that are actively hiring.

932
01:17:56,616 --> 01:18:04,347
Leon Noel: We identify like three to five people at each of those companies, and we're doing outreach to get in communication with those folks, learn more.

933
01:18:04,867 --> 01:18:09,814
Leon Noel: And what we're finding is that a lot of jobs just don't get posted.

934
01:18:10,618 --> 01:18:16,904
Leon Noel: a lot of times folks will be applying for one job that they wind up getting a different one just because they like the person.

935
01:18:17,565 --> 01:18:23,590
Leon Noel: We have this idea that tech is this meritocracy where if you know the skills, you get the job, it's not.

936
01:18:23,610 --> 01:18:34,461
Leon Noel: People want to work with people that they like, they want to work with people that they know and trust, and you can make that happen for yourself by really going this networking your way in pathway.

937
01:18:36,112 --> 01:18:44,799
Quincy Larson: So the term meritocracy is, it was actually like a joke because the author was like, this doesn't exist.

938
01:18:44,819 --> 01:18:45,860
Quincy Larson: This is absurd.

939
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,762
Quincy Larson: It's who you know.

940
01:18:49,062 --> 01:18:56,909
Quincy Larson: You're a skill unless you're, I mean, even the most demonstrably good pianists, for example, to talk about pianists as we talked about it earlier.

941
01:18:57,469 --> 01:19:02,914
Quincy Larson: like somebody saw you know um skill in them and like help them get observed.

942
01:19:02,994 --> 01:19:08,298
Quincy Larson: you know enrolled in some observatory or they had the time to play piano a lot with all.

943
01:19:08,339 --> 01:19:08,599
Quincy Larson: the other.

944
01:19:08,639 --> 01:19:10,300
Quincy Larson: kids were working in the shoe factory.

945
01:19:10,721 --> 01:19:11,261
Quincy Larson: you know in the.

946
01:19:11,441 --> 01:19:14,804
Quincy Larson: you know industrial revolution or whatever right like it takes.

947
01:19:16,045 --> 01:19:18,327
Quincy Larson: So everybody's circumstances are different.

948
01:19:18,387 --> 01:19:28,694
Quincy Larson: So I just want to like put the bed because I've never talked about this on the podcast, but we don't use the word meritocracy on here except to say that things aren't a meritocracy because they aren't.

949
01:19:28,934 --> 01:19:30,255
Quincy Larson: It's ridiculous to think that they are.

950
01:19:31,015 --> 01:19:35,899
Quincy Larson: The person who came up with it, I think, in a book was like just joking about it.

951
01:19:35,919 --> 01:19:36,559
Quincy Larson: Yeah.

952
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:45,163
Quincy Larson: Yeah, but there's like He defined meritocracy is like I think effort and intelligence.

953
01:19:45,683 --> 01:19:48,545
Quincy Larson: and how do you build intelligence through effort, right?

954
01:19:48,605 --> 01:19:55,928
Quincy Larson: Some of it may be like, you know endowed upon you But for most part we all work really hard.

955
01:19:56,008 --> 01:19:59,009
Quincy Larson: I study You know foreign languages like an hour a day.

956
01:19:59,069 --> 01:20:01,891
Quincy Larson: I play bass an hour a day you know.

957
01:20:01,951 --> 01:20:03,591
Quincy Larson: and like I still suck at those things.

958
01:20:03,671 --> 01:20:07,413
Quincy Larson: but sucking at something is the first step to being good at something and Right.

959
01:20:08,313 --> 01:20:12,974
Quincy Larson: So I also wanted to describe or like define like an acronym.

960
01:20:13,354 --> 01:20:16,875
Quincy Larson: ATS is Applicant Tracking System.

961
01:20:17,075 --> 01:20:17,495
Leon Noel: System.

962
01:20:17,555 --> 01:20:17,815
Leon Noel: Yeah.

963
01:20:17,875 --> 01:20:18,075
Leon Noel: Yeah.

964
01:20:18,115 --> 01:20:22,056
Quincy Larson: When you apply through like a web form, you're like applying into some algorithm.

965
01:20:22,076 --> 01:20:28,417
Quincy Larson: that's going to be like, OK, we didn't ask if they have a college degree because it's hip to say that we don't look for people who have college degrees.

966
01:20:28,477 --> 01:20:33,178
Quincy Larson: But in reality, our system is going to just filter you out because you don't have a college degree.

967
01:20:33,238 --> 01:20:34,238
Quincy Larson: We didn't put it on the thing.

968
01:20:35,058 --> 01:20:37,762
Quincy Larson: You know, I think I heard some study that like.

969
01:20:39,023 --> 01:20:44,409
Quincy Larson: it was a recent study like 700 job postings that didn't say they required a degree like zero.

970
01:20:44,469 --> 01:20:49,875
Quincy Larson: people got those jobs for software engineering for those roles, even though they didn't say because.

971
01:20:50,556 --> 01:20:53,598
Quincy Larson: if you don't have a degree, the ATS just simply filters you out.

972
01:20:53,618 --> 01:20:55,058
Quincy Larson: No human ever even reviews it, right?

973
01:20:55,479 --> 01:21:02,782
Quincy Larson: But the way I got my first job as a developer was through meetup.com, going to local Ruby developer meetup.

974
01:21:03,122 --> 01:21:06,384
Quincy Larson: And I got a job as a Rails developer, and the interview was very similar.

975
01:21:06,644 --> 01:21:12,087
Quincy Larson: Maybe you can describe the typical interview that 100 devs folks go through, because it's not like a leak code whiteboard.

976
01:21:12,467 --> 01:21:16,209
Quincy Larson: Maybe for some of them, but a lot of it is like, hey, I've already seen your projects.

977
01:21:16,749 --> 01:21:17,470
Quincy Larson: I know you can code.

978
01:21:17,930 --> 01:21:19,531
Quincy Larson: Are you a good fit for our organization, right?

979
01:21:20,171 --> 01:21:21,693
Leon Noel: It's about 50 50.

980
01:21:21,693 --> 01:21:29,440
Leon Noel: Yeah, we're talking across hundreds of people that have gotten jobs that I've like literally seen right and people have come and talked about them during our huddles.

981
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:39,510
Leon Noel: so we have a celebrations channel on our discord where you can like go through and see hundreds of people their stories how they got the jobs what the interviews were like and so that's really powerful to know that.

982
01:21:40,211 --> 01:21:49,075
Leon Noel: but it's about 50 50 and it's when they when they do an interview we're talking about sometimes there's not gonna be like a LeetCode style portion.

983
01:21:49,095 --> 01:21:51,275
Leon Noel: There's still gonna be behavioral questions.

984
01:21:51,615 --> 01:21:53,275
Leon Noel: There's still gonna be technical questions.

985
01:21:53,296 --> 01:21:55,076
Leon Noel: You're still gonna be walking through a project.

986
01:21:55,376 --> 01:22:02,637
Leon Noel: You might do some light like coding together, but for about half the folks that have gotten jobs, they haven't done like a LeetCode style question.

987
01:22:02,657 --> 01:22:06,038
Leon Noel: The other half you will, and then there's varying degrees of it.

988
01:22:06,418 --> 01:22:13,924
Leon Noel: And so, so many folks focus on like grinding out LeetCode until their eyes bleed and it's like, Yeah, if you're going for Fang, sure, that needs to be the thing that you do.

989
01:22:14,305 --> 01:22:25,430
Leon Noel: But if you're going for a local healthcare company in your medium-sized city, they're probably not going to know, like they're probably not gonna go through and do that level of interviewing.

990
01:22:25,951 --> 01:22:29,874
Leon Noel: And so one of the things we always say is like, don't go into your interviews like an accident.

991
01:22:30,294 --> 01:22:32,175
Leon Noel: Always ask what you're about to walk into.

992
01:22:32,356 --> 01:22:41,342
Leon Noel: They'll tell you, like almost every single time, if you just say like, hey, like I'm putting a lot of time and energy into this application, I would really appreciate just being fully prepared.

993
01:22:41,422 --> 01:22:43,203
Leon Noel: What am I about to walk into in this interview?

994
01:22:43,564 --> 01:22:46,566
Leon Noel: And they'll tell you, oh, you're just gonna meet with so-and-so and talk through a project, great.

995
01:22:47,006 --> 01:22:48,406
Leon Noel: Now you know how to prep for that interview.

996
01:22:48,506 --> 01:22:51,247
Leon Noel: Don't ever go into an interview if you don't know what you're about to walk into.

997
01:22:51,667 --> 01:22:59,449
Leon Noel: It's about half of our jobs have been not really needing some of those more aggressive skills, but it's a huge smell test.

998
01:22:59,489 --> 01:23:00,429
Leon Noel: It's a sniff test.

999
01:23:01,009 --> 01:23:03,930
Leon Noel: We like to say every single person that starts off at 100 dev smells.

1000
01:23:04,690 --> 01:23:07,651
Leon Noel: There's something about you that's going to stop you from getting the job.

1001
01:23:08,031 --> 01:23:19,656
Leon Noel: And it's your job to figure out what it is, get rid of the smell, and make sure you come across as a cool, confident professional that's done this, been there and is ready to get to work.

1002
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:23,818
Leon Noel: And if you can do that, you're going to be really successful getting jobs.

1003
01:23:23,938 --> 01:23:30,381
Leon Noel: And even folks that want to go the other more traditional interviews with like the leet codes and things like that, you're still passing a sniff test.

1004
01:23:30,861 --> 01:23:39,205
Leon Noel: I have seen folks that I consider just amazing, even done like competitive programming that do well in interviews and don't get the job and they wonder why.

1005
01:23:39,245 --> 01:23:42,086
Leon Noel: And then you look at their resume and you look at how they present themselves.

1006
01:23:42,546 --> 01:23:44,867
Leon Noel: their narrative, all that stuff matters.

1007
01:23:45,347 --> 01:23:46,248
Leon Noel: It really matters.

1008
01:23:46,268 --> 01:23:49,289
Leon Noel: You need to invest time in opening those doors as well.

1009
01:23:49,649 --> 01:23:50,629
Quincy Larson: Yeah, absolutely.

1010
01:23:50,969 --> 01:24:04,455
Quincy Larson: And I just want to emphasize, if you can figure out what that smell is, maybe it's that I don't have a degree and I'm getting filtered out of ATS or people are just not looking at me as a serious candidate just based on that virtue.

1011
01:24:04,715 --> 01:24:06,196
Quincy Larson: You can absolutely correct for that.

1012
01:24:06,216 --> 01:24:09,197
Quincy Larson: And I have lots of friends, lots of people on the Free Code Camp team.

1013
01:24:09,777 --> 01:24:11,959
Quincy Larson: dropped out of college or never even went to college, right?

1014
01:24:13,039 --> 01:24:27,269
Quincy Larson: And it's just one of those things where you have to figure out and empathize with the HR person, whoever you're talking to, and figure out what it is they're sniffing for, because usually they're just trying to figure out a way to quickly weed people out, so to speak.

1015
01:24:27,289 --> 01:24:28,650
Quincy Larson: So they're not the entertainment people, right?

1016
01:24:30,231 --> 01:24:30,491
Leon Noel: I don't know.

1017
01:24:30,511 --> 01:24:36,319
Leon Noel: One of the things we try really hard at 100 Days is make sure you know all the hacks and the secrets and what's really happening.

1018
01:24:36,919 --> 01:24:40,224
Leon Noel: Recruiters are using some sort of, like we said, ATS, some sort of filter.

1019
01:24:40,985 --> 01:24:43,247
Leon Noel: You know what to add to your resume to get past those filters.

1020
01:24:43,588 --> 01:24:47,473
Leon Noel: We use things like CV Compiler, which is a website that'll tell you what you're missing.

1021
01:24:48,113 --> 01:24:50,974
Leon Noel: We have our own resume template that's battle-tested.

1022
01:24:51,314 --> 01:24:53,615
Leon Noel: We follow the true F-shape pattern.

1023
01:24:53,695 --> 01:25:02,559
Leon Noel: If you watch recruiters with eye tracking, there's a video that's going really popular, it's done it again, where you watch the way they look, they read left to right, like most folks that read English.

1024
01:25:02,819 --> 01:25:06,721
Leon Noel: They're looking for those specific keywords at the front load of the F-shape pattern.

1025
01:25:07,041 --> 01:25:13,284
Leon Noel: If you know these things, you can get past these screen segments.

1026
01:25:13,645 --> 01:25:16,967
Leon Noel: And the other thing is people really need to work on how they talk about themselves.

1027
01:25:17,647 --> 01:25:20,289
Leon Noel: People go into the hunt too humble.

1028
01:25:20,809 --> 01:25:26,353
Leon Noel: This is your one chance in life to talk your talk, be proud of your previous experience.

1029
01:25:26,373 --> 01:25:35,559
Leon Noel: I don't care what you've done, having that previous experience makes you a badass and brings different skills to the table than someone that did.

1030
01:25:35,599 --> 01:25:38,281
Leon Noel: a four-year CS has only ever worked in computer science.

1031
01:25:39,722 --> 01:25:42,983
Leon Noel: you're different and that difference can be a value add to a lot of companies.

1032
01:25:43,083 --> 01:25:54,928
Leon Noel: And so knowing how to craft that into a narrative, like a logical reason from what you were doing to why you're the best software engineer they have in their candidate pool and being able to talk about yourself highly is super important.

1033
01:25:54,968 --> 01:25:56,948
Leon Noel: So if you're listening, what is your narrative?

1034
01:25:56,968 --> 01:25:57,729
Leon Noel: What is your story?

1035
01:25:58,009 --> 01:25:59,969
Leon Noel: Why are you the coolest thing since sliced bread?

1036
01:26:00,009 --> 01:26:01,310
Leon Noel: walking into that interview?

1037
01:26:01,330 --> 01:26:06,512
Leon Noel: And that's what we do a lot during like our huddles and at 100 does we have whole nights where we just craft stories.

1038
01:26:06,552 --> 01:26:12,696
Leon Noel: We'll have Dozens of people come up, they give us their life history, and we craft the narrative live.

1039
01:26:13,116 --> 01:26:16,859
Leon Noel: And then you just see an instant difference in how they're going through applications.

1040
01:26:17,499 --> 01:26:17,699
Quincy Larson: Yeah.

1041
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:26,565
Quincy Larson: And so, first of all, I would love if you can share the links to those, the CV, I'll pull up CV compiler, like if you have a resume template.

1042
01:26:27,246 --> 01:26:33,750
Quincy Larson: And like, we've talked a lot about 100 devs, and I feel like we could talk a whole lot more.

1043
01:26:33,770 --> 01:26:35,912
Quincy Larson: First of all, I want to make sure you still have a few minutes.

1044
01:26:36,112 --> 01:26:37,894
Leon Noel: I'm good to go for as long as you'll have me.

1045
01:26:37,914 --> 01:26:38,534
Leon Noel: Awesome.

1046
01:26:38,734 --> 01:26:39,455
Quincy Larson: Well, that's great news.

1047
01:26:42,337 --> 01:26:47,342
Quincy Larson: The main limiter is going to be the fact that I've drinked literally two liters of tea while I was sitting here talking with you.

1048
01:26:47,662 --> 01:26:49,123
Quincy Larson: So I may have to go to the bathroom at some point.

1049
01:26:49,384 --> 01:26:58,011
Quincy Larson: But what I really want is just to tease out as many high-level insights that we can get into this podcast.

1050
01:26:58,031 --> 01:27:20,444
Quincy Larson: I just want to end on as many pieces of actionable advice as you can share as somebody who has become a developer, who's worked as a software engineer, who's even built a successful project, I guess three or two projects, and then you're very actively high up in Resilient Coders too, which sounds like a really, and I want to tease as many of those out of you as I can.

1051
01:27:21,725 --> 01:27:26,227
Quincy Larson: For the benefit of the audience, and for the benefit of myself, I've been furiously taking notes through this whole thing.

1052
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:35,627
Quincy Larson: Some questions I have are, I guess, what are some questions I should be asking?

1053
01:27:35,988 --> 01:27:45,058
Quincy Larson: What are some interesting things that people never ask you that are really helpful, that would be helpful for the many people out there learning the code?

1054
01:27:46,340 --> 01:27:47,741
Quincy Larson: Okay, what is a big mistake?

1055
01:27:48,582 --> 01:27:49,443
Quincy Larson: We can think about that.

1056
01:27:49,463 --> 01:27:50,864
Quincy Larson: Maybe you can think of some other things.

1057
01:27:50,904 --> 01:28:03,374
Quincy Larson: But what is a big mistake that you see developers make, other than over-optimizing on their skills, for example, and not enough on their network or their reputation, or figuring out how to empathize with recruiters?

1058
01:28:03,414 --> 01:28:09,478
Quincy Larson: And I don't mean be buddies with them, but you always want to understand other people's perspectives.

1059
01:28:09,518 --> 01:28:28,550
Quincy Larson: There's no disadvantage to having more perspectives compacted in your head, being able to build with more verisimilitude models of other people and how they're approaching the world and what they're looking for, how you can find the job that needs to be done and you can do it for that person, right?

1060
01:28:28,570 --> 01:28:29,270
Quincy Larson: Yeah.

1061
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:33,772
Leon Noel: I guess I'll, I'll gear it towards folks that are like learning how to code and trying to get a job.

1062
01:28:34,253 --> 01:28:45,278
Leon Noel: I think the biggest mistake outside of the things like not investing early in networking and, um, over investing and things that aren't going to really move the needle in terms of you getting a job is there's, there's two things that I think.

1063
01:28:47,139 --> 01:28:49,360
Leon Noel: lead to most folks not being successful.

1064
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:54,042
Leon Noel: And the number one thing is going into your days like an accident.

1065
01:28:55,142 --> 01:29:05,627
Leon Noel: If you're going into your days like an accident, and you don't have a game plan for your day, your week, your month, and you're trying to commit to a process that's gonna take years, you're not gonna be successful.

1066
01:29:06,247 --> 01:29:12,910
Leon Noel: And I've worked for folks from all different walks of life, the folks that make a plan for what they want, like, what do you want for yourself?

1067
01:29:13,550 --> 01:29:14,590
Leon Noel: What do you want for your family?

1068
01:29:14,610 --> 01:29:15,751
Leon Noel: What do you want for your loved ones?

1069
01:29:15,771 --> 01:29:17,031
Leon Noel: Like, what do you want?

1070
01:29:17,631 --> 01:29:20,332
Leon Noel: And then what are the steps you're going to take to get there?

1071
01:29:20,732 --> 01:29:23,293
Leon Noel: That plan helps you get through the trough of sorrow.

1072
01:29:23,313 --> 01:29:28,354
Leon Noel: It helps you get through the days where you don't have motivation, when the discipline is fleeting.

1073
01:29:30,555 --> 01:29:32,958
Leon Noel: how do you stay true to what you want?

1074
01:29:32,978 --> 01:29:34,160
Leon Noel: And you should have it written down.

1075
01:29:34,180 --> 01:29:35,942
Leon Noel: You should have it on your wall.

1076
01:29:36,182 --> 01:29:41,028
Leon Noel: There's a reason why I have your photo as the background of my wallpaper every once in a while.

1077
01:29:41,048 --> 01:29:43,831
Leon Noel: It's because I need to know what I'm shooting for and what do I want?

1078
01:29:43,851 --> 01:29:44,692
Leon Noel: What do I want for myself?

1079
01:29:44,712 --> 01:29:45,673
Leon Noel: What do I want for my community?

1080
01:29:46,054 --> 01:29:56,162
Leon Noel: And having that why, everyone that's trying to learn code needs to go on some long walks with no podcast, no music, no anything, and just ask yourself, what do I want?

1081
01:29:56,202 --> 01:29:57,002
Leon Noel: Like, what's my future?

1082
01:29:57,022 --> 01:29:58,223
Leon Noel: Like, what do I want for myself?

1083
01:29:58,563 --> 01:30:02,126
Leon Noel: Because until you have that, it's really hard to push through.

1084
01:30:02,166 --> 01:30:07,849
Leon Noel: And so I have a lot of people that come and they say they want it, but they only kind of want it, right?

1085
01:30:08,010 --> 01:30:09,170
Leon Noel: It's like a very famous Dr.

1086
01:30:09,350 --> 01:30:09,971
Leon Noel: Thomas speech.

1087
01:30:09,991 --> 01:30:11,232
Leon Noel: Like, they just kind of want it.

1088
01:30:11,792 --> 01:30:14,894
Leon Noel: And until you really want it, and that can come from a lot of different ways.

1089
01:30:14,914 --> 01:30:16,415
Leon Noel: It can come from being fucking hungry.

1090
01:30:16,735 --> 01:30:20,037
Leon Noel: It can come from wanting the respect of your family.

1091
01:30:20,257 --> 01:30:21,518
Leon Noel: It can come from a lot of different places.

1092
01:30:21,878 --> 01:30:24,500
Leon Noel: But until you have that, you're not gonna make it through.

1093
01:30:26,501 --> 01:30:40,005
Leon Noel: So having that hammered down and really having it visible, putting it somewhere on the wall, knowing what it is, and then every day, Before I go to bed, I write out the three things I wanna get done the next day.

1094
01:30:40,805 --> 01:30:42,666
Leon Noel: Once a month, what are my goals for the month?

1095
01:30:43,286 --> 01:30:46,927
Leon Noel: Once a year, not once a year, every couple of months, what am I trying to get done for the year?

1096
01:30:47,507 --> 01:30:48,968
Leon Noel: And I hold myself to it.

1097
01:30:49,328 --> 01:30:53,009
Leon Noel: And the last piece I'll say about this is I get buy-in from the folks that matter most to me.

1098
01:30:53,629 --> 01:30:54,849
Leon Noel: So it's not something internal to me.

1099
01:30:55,049 --> 01:31:00,471
Leon Noel: I know if I wanna be successful in this, I need to get the buy-in of my wife, right?

1100
01:31:00,931 --> 01:31:02,211
Leon Noel: Hey, this is the thing I wanna do.

1101
01:31:02,772 --> 01:31:03,772
Leon Noel: It's gonna take a lot of time.

1102
01:31:04,795 --> 01:31:23,112
Leon Noel: It's gonna take some nights and weekends away from us being together and with our family, and I need you to understand why I'm doing it, why it's important, and can I have a little bit of your trust, and I'll prove that to you over time that it's a worthwhile investment, but I need you to know why I'm doing this and get that buy-in.

1103
01:31:23,852 --> 01:31:36,262
Leon Noel: Because if you don't have that buy-in, especially if you stay still at home with family that doesn't get it, if you're not being as present with your loved ones, that's going to build up some resentment.

1104
01:31:36,723 --> 01:31:39,245
Leon Noel: And for a lot of folks, that's another reason why they're not successful.

1105
01:31:39,325 --> 01:31:41,346
Leon Noel: So don't go into your days like an accident.

1106
01:31:41,486 --> 01:31:42,627
Leon Noel: Have a plan for your days.

1107
01:31:43,068 --> 01:31:45,670
Leon Noel: Know what your why is and get buy-in from the folks that matter most.

1108
01:31:46,564 --> 01:31:51,847
Quincy Larson: Yeah, that giving buy-in is so important because learning to code is a long, long journey.

1109
01:31:52,027 --> 01:31:53,588
Quincy Larson: And you get all hyped up.

1110
01:31:53,628 --> 01:31:59,991
Quincy Larson: You get like these, you know, probably YouTube ads or, you know, ads on the side of your coding tutorials.

1111
01:32:00,351 --> 01:32:04,093
Quincy Larson: Learn to code in just three months and get a job paying like 200K.

1112
01:32:04,333 --> 01:32:06,815
Quincy Larson: Like, you know, whatever, you know, and.

1113
01:32:07,515 --> 01:32:12,640
Quincy Larson: To be fair, there are plenty of developers who do learn to code very quickly and do get jobs.

1114
01:32:13,521 --> 01:32:23,630
Quincy Larson: I've had lots of friends who transitioned from working on Wall Street and they went to some expensive, intensive coding program and they were able to then go get a job in Silicon Valley.

1115
01:32:23,990 --> 01:32:25,512
Quincy Larson: But they already had college degrees.

1116
01:32:26,232 --> 01:32:29,955
Quincy Larson: They already had, you know, like, Probably figured out how to plan.

1117
01:32:30,955 --> 01:32:47,241
Quincy Larson: they probably had an understanding of like a lot of the you know learning Techniques that we've been talking about and most importantly they had a lot of money and they were able to just focus on it exclusively and Attend an intensive in-person boot camp like and that era may have passed.

1118
01:32:47,521 --> 01:32:53,704
Quincy Larson: it may be that it's just a little harder now to to be able to get a job just because you should learn math, right?

1119
01:32:53,744 --> 01:33:00,307
Quincy Larson: Like it used to be back in the day, you could just learn some WordPress and you could probably go get some clients do WordPress work.

1120
01:33:00,367 --> 01:33:18,993
Quincy Larson: And it may be that case, but with the global market and the level of competition you're going to get from places like India, Nigeria China like tons of extremely educated extremely hungry people are coming from all these places and You know, frankly, they're gonna eat your lunch if you're not putting in the time and effort.

1121
01:33:19,354 --> 01:33:23,015
Quincy Larson: Benjamin Franklin said few people plan to fail.

1122
01:33:23,455 --> 01:33:26,439
Quincy Larson: most people who fail are fail to plan.

1123
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:28,460
Quincy Larson: That's a paraphrase of what he said.

1124
01:33:28,580 --> 01:33:29,561
Quincy Larson: It's not an exact note.

1125
01:33:29,621 --> 01:33:32,142
Quincy Larson: But it is like 100% what Leon's saying here.

1126
01:33:33,862 --> 01:33:37,944
Quincy Larson: And yeah, so I just want to emphasize, like, getting buy-in from your family.

1127
01:33:37,984 --> 01:33:46,830
Quincy Larson: Like, when I learned to code, again, I don't want to make this all about me, but like, I told my wife, like, hey, like, I've got this job as a soft as a school director.

1128
01:33:46,890 --> 01:33:47,030
Quincy Larson: Right.

1129
01:33:47,110 --> 01:33:49,291
Quincy Larson: And I would like to become a software engineer.

1130
01:33:49,972 --> 01:33:51,593
Quincy Larson: And we had double income.

1131
01:33:51,613 --> 01:33:53,835
Quincy Larson: We had insurance, which is a huge deal here in the U.S.

1132
01:33:55,196 --> 01:33:55,937
Quincy Larson: through her work.

1133
01:33:56,777 --> 01:33:59,760
Quincy Larson: So even if I left my job, we could continue to have health insurance.

1134
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:02,863
Quincy Larson: And I just grinded every single day and I ever.

1135
01:34:03,223 --> 01:34:05,465
Quincy Larson: I didn't precisely what you're talking about planning out.

1136
01:34:05,605 --> 01:34:07,527
Quincy Larson: Okay, what am I going to accomplish the next few days?

1137
01:34:07,847 --> 01:34:09,488
Quincy Larson: because planning is everything like.

1138
01:34:09,809 --> 01:34:17,976
Quincy Larson: it's so important to have a plan and to stick to plan and to have goals that are Measurable and that are within your control.

1139
01:34:17,996 --> 01:34:18,677
Quincy Larson: That's another mistake.

1140
01:34:18,717 --> 01:34:21,299
Quincy Larson: I see a lot of people make is People be like?

1141
01:34:21,499 --> 01:34:38,852
Quincy Larson: my goal is to get you know 100,000 YouTube subscribers this year or my goal is to get you know a job paying like N thousand dollars or to get in freelance clients, you know, those are not things that you can directly control and You can't control the outcome, but you can control the input.

1142
01:34:39,273 --> 01:34:45,978
Quincy Larson: My goal is to play bass for an hour a day or whatever goal I might have at a given moment.

1143
01:34:46,018 --> 01:34:54,845
Leon Noel: James Clear of Atomic Habits has a very famous quote that I love so much that says, we don't rise to the level of our goals, we fall to the levels of our systems.

1144
01:34:55,385 --> 01:35:09,101
Leon Noel: And so this idea that we have all these lofty goals, but if you're not putting in the systems, how you're going to play the bass for an hour each day, study your languages for an hour each day, and the process for that, it's just not going to work out for you in the long run.

1145
01:35:09,881 --> 01:35:10,342
Quincy Larson: Yeah, absolutely.

1146
01:35:12,952 --> 01:35:16,156
Quincy Larson: We've talked a lot, and of course you and I, we grew up in the U.S.

1147
01:35:16,296 --> 01:35:18,038
Quincy Larson: You grew up in Philly, I grew up in Oklahoma City.

1148
01:35:19,259 --> 01:35:20,561
Quincy Larson: And here in the

1149
01:35:20,641 --> 01:35:20,941
Quincy Larson: U.S.,

1150
01:35:21,182 --> 01:35:33,834
Quincy Larson: even though things are not equal by a long shot, it's a very unequal society, we still have vestiges of, you know, history, going back 400 years, right?

1151
01:35:34,274 --> 01:35:38,855
Quincy Larson: Like the warp, essentially the haves and the have-nots.

1152
01:35:41,156 --> 01:35:46,317
Quincy Larson: But in the US, we're pretty well off compared to folks in a lot of countries.

1153
01:35:47,157 --> 01:35:57,960
Quincy Larson: For example, like the hyper-competition in places like India and China, where you've got so many people getting CS degrees and trying to compete and so few employers.

1154
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:08,803
Quincy Larson: Or Nigeria, where there are so many amazing developers, like, I think it's like the third or fourth largest community in Free Code Camp, people that use Free Code Camp is Nigeria.

1155
01:36:09,143 --> 01:36:11,784
Quincy Larson: But if you look at Nigeria, there aren't a lot of big employers.

1156
01:36:12,404 --> 01:36:13,904
Quincy Larson: And the government's kind of a mess.

1157
01:36:14,444 --> 01:36:17,385
Quincy Larson: And as a result, there's not a lot of opportunity, even though there's a lot of talent.

1158
01:36:17,445 --> 01:36:25,027
Quincy Larson: So a lot of those people have to move overseas to like Europe or to the United States or wherever they can find opportunity, right?

1159
01:36:25,527 --> 01:36:31,329
Quincy Larson: Like, a lot of the, What is the proportion of people doing 100 devs who are outside of the U.S.

1160
01:36:31,549 --> 01:36:32,790
Quincy Larson: and how?

1161
01:36:33,150 --> 01:36:36,711
Quincy Larson: what have you observed about those people that might be helpful for them?

1162
01:36:38,472 --> 01:36:38,792
Quincy Larson: Yeah.

1163
01:36:38,872 --> 01:36:41,873
Quincy Larson: And like just a follow up question I'll tack on is like, do they need to move to the U.S.

1164
01:36:42,093 --> 01:36:44,634
Quincy Larson: to be able to be successful in software engineering?

1165
01:36:44,754 --> 01:36:47,234
Quincy Larson: or are there other paths you've seen people succeed with?

1166
01:36:47,314 --> 01:36:47,595
Quincy Larson: Yeah.

1167
01:36:47,935 --> 01:36:50,355
Leon Noel: So I would say about half our community is from the U.S.

1168
01:36:50,415 --> 01:36:51,876
Leon Noel: and about half is from everywhere else.

1169
01:36:52,316 --> 01:37:00,326
Leon Noel: In fact, the first jobs we ever got were not from the U.S They were from Brazil, then Poland, UK, and then a bunch of other places in South America.

1170
01:37:01,027 --> 01:37:05,793
Leon Noel: And so a lot of our community and folks that have gotten jobs haven't been from the U.S.

1171
01:37:05,853 --> 01:37:06,273
Leon Noel: centric.

1172
01:37:06,353 --> 01:37:09,878
Leon Noel: And so the first thing I always say is whenever somebody from outside the U.S.

1173
01:37:10,618 --> 01:37:15,738
Leon Noel: says I want to get a job, I just tell them bluntly, it's way harder.

1174
01:37:16,459 --> 01:37:19,860
Leon Noel: Don't let anyone convince you that it's going to be the same pathway as somebody from the US.

1175
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:21,741
Leon Noel: It's going to be a way more difficult journey.

1176
01:37:22,082 --> 01:37:25,523
Leon Noel: And there's a very couple of like very key things that you have to keep in mind.

1177
01:37:26,624 --> 01:37:31,446
Leon Noel: One, the visa sponsorship issue in the United States is wild.

1178
01:37:31,566 --> 01:37:33,828
Leon Noel: It goes to a lottery most years, right?

1179
01:37:34,288 --> 01:37:37,710
Leon Noel: And so banking on that is like a pathway into an engineering career.

1180
01:37:37,770 --> 01:37:42,173
Leon Noel: if you're from a area that doesn't have like that strong of a local tech economy is very hard.

1181
01:37:42,733 --> 01:37:47,116
Leon Noel: The competition for companies that hire remotely is brutal.

1182
01:37:47,577 --> 01:37:50,719
Leon Noel: It's even more brutal when you look at the companies that hire globally.

1183
01:37:50,839 --> 01:37:52,820
Leon Noel: So a lot of people think, oh, I'll get a remote tech job.

1184
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:58,324
Leon Noel: No, even though they're remote, they only hire folks from the US or from a very specific select countries.

1185
01:37:58,785 --> 01:38:06,437
Leon Noel: So finding a group of folks that hire globally, remotely, that's a very narrow pool.

1186
01:38:06,838 --> 01:38:11,160
Leon Noel: So the first thing I would recommend that you do is build a hit list of those companies.

1187
01:38:11,180 --> 01:38:12,581
Leon Noel: There are lists you can find online.

1188
01:38:12,941 --> 01:38:15,183
Leon Noel: There are a couple hundred of those companies.

1189
01:38:15,783 --> 01:38:17,864
Leon Noel: You need to be best friends with everybody that works at that company.

1190
01:38:18,064 --> 01:38:20,246
Leon Noel: And you mentioned building your reputation.

1191
01:38:20,306 --> 01:38:22,247
Leon Noel: This is something I really recommend.

1192
01:38:22,287 --> 01:38:28,291
Leon Noel: folks that are coming from a location that doesn't have a traditional tech economy, is your reputation matters a lot.

1193
01:38:29,131 --> 01:38:36,698
Leon Noel: We talk about building authority a lot in 100Dev, so picking a niche or a topic that you know very, very well, generating content around it.

1194
01:38:36,718 --> 01:38:43,604
Leon Noel: So when somebody thinks about, I don't know, authentication, they think about you and the blog post that you've written and the depth of knowledge that you can bring.

1195
01:38:43,964 --> 01:38:51,531
Leon Noel: That way, when you're applying to these global remote companies, you have something that nobody else really has, this intangible thing that helps set you apart.

1196
01:38:51,931 --> 01:38:53,392
Leon Noel: And so the first thing I say, it's harder.

1197
01:38:54,261 --> 01:39:09,736
Leon Noel: Building authority or reputation is super important and not going into your job search like an accident, it's not gonna happen if you don't have a very strong game plan and you're building the references and helping pass that sniff test that these companies are putting out there.

1198
01:39:09,776 --> 01:39:11,337
Leon Noel: If you do those things, you'll be successful.

1199
01:39:11,357 --> 01:39:13,519
Leon Noel: We've helped hundreds of people in that situation get a job.

1200
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:15,281
Leon Noel: It's just a way more difficult pathway.

1201
01:39:16,041 --> 01:39:16,281
Quincy Larson: Yeah.

1202
01:39:16,902 --> 01:39:25,226
Quincy Larson: And just on that note of building authority, what are some of the most, I guess, immediate things someone can do?

1203
01:39:25,506 --> 01:39:26,727
Quincy Larson: Let's say you already have the skills.

1204
01:39:26,967 --> 01:39:35,872
Quincy Larson: Let's say you've been coding for a long time and you just want to be able to get a job, preferably at a multinational company, many of which are, of course, US-based.

1205
01:39:37,333 --> 01:39:50,182
Quincy Larson: And you would love over the next five or ten years to eventually get a visa and come to the US where salaries are double what they are in Europe and where we have a high degree of freedom that people in other countries don't necessarily enjoy.

1206
01:39:50,542 --> 01:39:51,843
Quincy Larson: I mean, it is a good place to live.

1207
01:39:52,084 --> 01:39:53,725
Quincy Larson: I like living in the US.

1208
01:39:54,265 --> 01:40:06,929
Quincy Larson: I guess it's easy for me to say that as a middle class guy who speaks English natively and has US citizenship and doesn't have to deal with my H1B being shifted around and getting companies to sponsor me and all that stuff.

1209
01:40:06,949 --> 01:40:09,509
Quincy Larson: But I can definitely understand the appeal.

1210
01:40:09,549 --> 01:40:15,191
Quincy Larson: I can understand why so many people are trying to immigrate to the US every day.

1211
01:40:15,271 --> 01:40:21,413
Quincy Larson: But what would be some practical ways that they can establish authority, as you said?

1212
01:40:22,313 --> 01:40:32,762
Leon Noel: Yeah, so I think when you are trying to stand out amongst lots of other talented individuals, it doesn't have to be anything wild.

1213
01:40:32,782 --> 01:40:41,590
Leon Noel: I really do think building a list of companies that are on your targeted range, and the H1B processes, I've helped sponsor a lot of H1Bs.

1214
01:40:41,650 --> 01:40:42,191
Quincy Larson: Oh, okay, cool.

1215
01:40:42,731 --> 01:40:45,053
Leon Noel: We can talk about like, that's a whole other beast in and of itself.

1216
01:40:45,133 --> 01:40:47,534
Leon Noel: That's like, you have to be an exceptional talent.

1217
01:40:47,554 --> 01:40:49,115
Leon Noel: You have to do these things that will just stand out.

1218
01:40:49,135 --> 01:40:50,036
Leon Noel: Like that's a whole other thing.

1219
01:40:50,376 --> 01:40:51,777
Leon Noel: You're talking about like global remote company.

1220
01:40:51,797 --> 01:40:52,498
Leon Noel: Like what can you do right now?

1221
01:40:52,538 --> 01:40:56,280
Leon Noel: I'm thinking about somebody right now that wants to get a job.

1222
01:40:57,481 --> 01:41:00,924
Leon Noel: My process probably wouldn't be the H1B coming to the US right away.

1223
01:41:00,944 --> 01:41:06,527
Leon Noel: It'd be these like global remote companies and then maybe expanding to companies that could sponsor.

1224
01:41:07,568 --> 01:41:15,291
Leon Noel: But a lot of times you're gonna need more, more credentials you're going to need, like degrees might actually become a thing if you're trying to go that sponsorship route.

1225
01:41:16,092 --> 01:41:33,018
Leon Noel: So I recommend right now, if you're someone in Nigeria or India, looking at these global hire and remote companies, figuring out what they do, building a list of them, building a list of all the people that you know that work there, adding them to a Twitter list, right?

1226
01:41:33,058 --> 01:41:46,688
Leon Noel: Like each person added to a Twitter list, start engaging with their content, just liking stuff at first, don't be spammy, don't be weird, just like engaging with them, liking their content, congratulating them when they get a new project built, right?

1227
01:41:46,728 --> 01:42:02,379
Leon Noel: Like building that network of folks that know who you are over time, like you become like an acquaintance, like you can go from a nobody to like, they have no idea who you are to an acquaintance just by regular interaction on LinkedIn, Twitter, And there's a fine line between being weird with it, right?

1228
01:42:02,659 --> 01:42:05,421
Leon Noel: We at 100 Dozen always joke, it's not stalking, it's networking.

1229
01:42:05,761 --> 01:42:08,362
Leon Noel: And so you wanna make sure that you're not crossing that line.

1230
01:42:10,043 --> 01:42:14,366
Leon Noel: And then starting to realize what these companies have trouble with, right?

1231
01:42:14,706 --> 01:42:17,468
Leon Noel: You're engaging with these content, you're seeing the things that they're doing.

1232
01:42:17,948 --> 01:42:22,711
Leon Noel: Are they having trouble implementing, I don't know, AI or LLMs?

1233
01:42:23,211 --> 01:42:25,113
Leon Noel: Great, that's the content you need to start regenerating.

1234
01:42:25,753 --> 01:42:31,866
Leon Noel: Build your authority about, How do they integrate these tools into their daily process?

1235
01:42:31,906 --> 01:42:32,846
Leon Noel: You should have a blog.

1236
01:42:33,706 --> 01:42:35,807
Leon Noel: You should have a YouTube.

1237
01:42:36,528 --> 01:42:38,609
Leon Noel: You should have something where you're putting content out there.

1238
01:42:38,929 --> 01:42:46,452
Leon Noel: You're getting feedback from them and from community of some sort to where you're building up that, hey, I'm not just somebody that says I do this.

1239
01:42:46,512 --> 01:42:47,812
Leon Noel: You can look at my content.

1240
01:42:47,832 --> 01:42:49,033
Leon Noel: You can look at the things I'm doing.

1241
01:42:49,573 --> 01:42:53,355
Leon Noel: You can look at the things that I say I've done and be able to see that very clearly.

1242
01:42:53,935 --> 01:42:57,296
Leon Noel: And also, by doing that, you're practicing how you talk about these things.

1243
01:42:57,316 --> 01:43:12,780
Leon Noel: You're practicing, maybe if English is your second language, you're getting more comfortable with these things that when it comes time to pass the sniff test, you are, because these people you've been engaging with for a year plus, they've seen your content, they know who you are, they know what you're capable of.

1244
01:43:13,121 --> 01:43:15,361
Leon Noel: That makes getting into these orgs a little bit easier.

1245
01:43:16,001 --> 01:43:16,501
Quincy Larson: Absolutely.

1246
01:43:16,501 --> 01:43:18,202
Quincy Larson: 100% agreed.

1247
01:43:18,602 --> 01:43:19,562
Quincy Larson: Based on my limited knowledge.

1248
01:43:19,922 --> 01:43:21,623
Quincy Larson: I think it sounds like you have a lot more knowledge about that.

1249
01:43:22,034 --> 01:43:26,138
Quincy Larson: So what I would like to ask then is like, let's flip this around.

1250
01:43:26,779 --> 01:43:34,326
Quincy Larson: Employers who want to bring in more folks and this can, we can definitely start by talking about folks from overseas.

1251
01:43:34,766 --> 01:43:47,078
Quincy Larson: If you want talent, if you want to be able to tap that talent and you don't want to like go to some consultancy or something in some other country and say, give me like 20 devs, right, go to Infosys or whatever, like you want to literally get the best talent

1252
01:43:47,638 --> 01:43:47,859
Leon Noel: from

1253
01:43:48,219 --> 01:43:52,423
Quincy Larson: India or from Nigeria just by picking developer by developer yourself.

1254
01:43:52,783 --> 01:43:56,848
Quincy Larson: You're trying to build out your company or you're a hiring manager and you're just trying to build a team.

1255
01:43:58,289 --> 01:44:05,596
Quincy Larson: What strategies, what advice would you give to those people so that they can actually find talented people and what should they be looking for?

1256
01:44:06,377 --> 01:44:07,978
Leon Noel: I think partnerships are really great.

1257
01:44:08,018 --> 01:44:10,719
Leon Noel: So we work with a lot of hiring partners at Resilient Coders.

1258
01:44:11,219 --> 01:44:15,101
Leon Noel: We've sent dozens of folks to Amazon through Resilient Coders.

1259
01:44:15,361 --> 01:44:21,284
Leon Noel: We have these very strong partnerships with a lot of orgs that need a good solid pipeline of talent.

1260
01:44:21,624 --> 01:44:24,125
Leon Noel: And so partnering with communities is a really good way to do that.

1261
01:44:25,005 --> 01:44:31,050
Leon Noel: If you came to RC, it was encoders, or you came to 100 devs, and you said, give me the best of the best, I would talk to you.

1262
01:44:31,070 --> 01:44:35,774
Leon Noel: I'd make sure that your job is doing all the things that it needs to be done to be done equitably.

1263
01:44:35,814 --> 01:44:52,288
Leon Noel: And if I felt that that was the case, I would give you all the folks, you would have a pipeline that was full for days of highly, qualified, incredibly talented talent from wherever you need them to be from or anywhere you'd want to support as well, like we can make that happen.

1264
01:44:52,328 --> 01:44:57,692
Leon Noel: And so I think for folks that are looking for a good pipeline, just working with communities.

1265
01:44:57,753 --> 01:45:12,179
Leon Noel: So I would of course say Working with myself you, I always think of Paris black tech pipeline does this work really well where they're able to get you a very strong source of talent from anywhere from entry level to super senior.

1266
01:45:12,859 --> 01:45:15,781
Leon Noel: And so, figuring out these different orgs that have.

1267
01:45:16,741 --> 01:45:23,067
Leon Noel: a surplus of talented engineering talent could be a great way to build those funnels for you.

1268
01:45:23,187 --> 01:45:24,768
Quincy Larson: Yeah, absolutely.

1269
01:45:25,168 --> 01:45:40,942
Quincy Larson: And then for organizations that just want to be more representative of the folks in their community, let's say like it's not necessarily remote, but here in the US, Los Angeles, for example, like there's a tech startup and they're looking for engineers.

1270
01:45:41,362 --> 01:45:54,616
Quincy Larson: What I guess, general tips would you give to employers so that they can be inclusive and they can make sure that they're bringing on talent that actually represents the local population instead of just bringing in a bunch of, you know, Stanford grads or something like that, right?

1271
01:45:54,956 --> 01:45:58,981
Leon Noel: Yeah, I think it takes champions within a company that actually care about these things.

1272
01:45:59,421 --> 01:46:03,644
Leon Noel: Of course, you can read like the McKinsey reports, a more diverse workforce equals better outcomes, right?

1273
01:46:03,664 --> 01:46:16,212
Leon Noel: So a lot of companies know these things to be true, but it takes someone on the inside that cares about building an equitable workforce for this to actually happen, especially when things like DEI and these initiatives are being contested in the courts.

1274
01:46:16,633 --> 01:46:23,058
Leon Noel: A lot of companies are becoming a little bit more shy around being 10 toes down, right?

1275
01:46:23,478 --> 01:46:27,141
Leon Noel: And so I think if this is the case, it really doesn't come from top down.

1276
01:46:27,202 --> 01:46:31,286
Leon Noel: It comes from individuals looking around and saying, you know what?

1277
01:46:31,686 --> 01:46:38,853
Leon Noel: I live in a community that is 25% black and brown, but only 1% of our workforce is of color.

1278
01:46:39,113 --> 01:46:40,735
Leon Noel: There's something fundamentally wrong here.

1279
01:46:40,795 --> 01:46:49,360
Leon Noel: When we looked in Boston, where I spent most of my career, We had the second largest tech economy, but double-digit unemployment rates in our communities of color.

1280
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:51,060
Leon Noel: There's a fundamental mismatch.

1281
01:46:51,480 --> 01:47:04,805
Leon Noel: And so we had a group of individuals that realized that this is just woefully inequitable, and they would go to town, they would go to fight the fight every single day to bring one person along, then to bring two along.

1282
01:47:04,865 --> 01:47:07,365
Leon Noel: And the thing is, it can compound.

1283
01:47:08,166 --> 01:47:13,388
Leon Noel: Once you have folks in these positions of power, you can turn around and help lift up more along with you.

1284
01:47:13,488 --> 01:47:16,369
Leon Noel: So I don't think it needs to be like, like a company-wide thing.

1285
01:47:16,389 --> 01:47:25,573
Leon Noel: I think anybody that's listening to this call has this ability to fight for what they know is right, to turn around and say, you know what, I want to make an equitable pathway in my company.

1286
01:47:25,593 --> 01:47:33,896
Leon Noel: And I'm going to work really, really hard for the next open role for it to be someone that deserves to be here, but might not have the opportunity.

1287
01:47:34,727 --> 01:47:39,631
Quincy Larson: yeah and that's a huge part of 100 devs like as far as i can tell from like.

1288
01:47:39,671 --> 01:48:07,408
Quincy Larson: listening to a lot of your episodes and stuff like instead of asking people to like necessarily donate to 100 devs or uh like you tell them send the elevator back down is something you've said a few times like like try for every one of the 100 devs cohort members, the learners, they should try to find somebody else who's an alum and bring them onto their company so that they can kind of essentially

1289
01:48:07,868 --> 01:48:08,109
Leon Noel: be

1290
01:48:09,009 --> 01:48:11,789
Quincy Larson: increasing the number of alumni within these organizations.

1291
01:48:11,809 --> 01:48:15,590
Leon Noel: So in the free software community, we have a word gratis, right?

1292
01:48:15,810 --> 01:48:20,271
Leon Noel: It's not free, it's gratis, meaning that there's like no cost, like there's no like monetary cost.

1293
01:48:20,792 --> 01:48:23,693
Leon Noel: And so 100 devs is gratis.

1294
01:48:23,713 --> 01:48:24,794
Leon Noel: I mean, there's no money.

1295
01:48:25,094 --> 01:48:26,315
Leon Noel: No money should ever come out of your pocket.

1296
01:48:26,355 --> 01:48:29,157
Leon Noel: I never want to see a dollar come out of your pocket for anything.

1297
01:48:29,898 --> 01:48:31,259
Leon Noel: There's no way that you can give us that dollar.

1298
01:48:31,279 --> 01:48:31,840
Leon Noel: We don't want it.

1299
01:48:32,360 --> 01:48:33,061
Leon Noel: But it's not free.

1300
01:48:33,421 --> 01:48:49,014
Leon Noel: And the reason why it's not free is because we expect that when you get the job, that you turn around and help three more get into the same position that you have, whether it's helping answer questions, whether it is literally helping people apply and get into the pipeline for your company.

1301
01:48:49,674 --> 01:48:56,857
Leon Noel: The expectation is that this community has invested thousands of hours into your success.

1302
01:48:57,317 --> 01:49:00,838
Leon Noel: And the thing that we ask is that you turn around and give a little bit of that time back.

1303
01:49:01,298 --> 01:49:19,322
Leon Noel: And that's the reason why 100Devs has been so successful is that we have folks that have made it to the upper echelon that are now senior developers at the best tech companies in the world that are still giving up their time every single day on our discord and our huddles to make sure that the next folks are successful.

1304
01:49:21,468 --> 01:49:28,631
Quincy Larson: That is a beautiful note to end on, just the virtue of this organization that you've birthed into the world.

1305
01:49:29,592 --> 01:49:33,173
Quincy Larson: But let's not end quite yet, because I want to ask, what are the future initiatives?

1306
01:49:33,694 --> 01:49:38,856
Quincy Larson: What does 2024, the rest of 2024, maybe even 2025, 2026?

1307
01:49:38,856 --> 01:49:47,840
Quincy Larson: Free Code Camp, we think, literally a decade out, like working on this computer science degree program that will take another six years to complete all the coursework for, plus another.

1308
01:49:48,380 --> 01:49:57,326
Quincy Larson: Five years together longitudinal data plus probably another five years to have the data, you know Approved by a creditor so we can get the degree program accredited.

1309
01:49:57,806 --> 01:50:01,049
Quincy Larson: free computer science bachelor's degree free.

1310
01:50:01,289 --> 01:50:06,332
Leon Noel: I was tweeting up a storehouse telling everybody in their mom.

1311
01:50:06,412 --> 01:50:10,495
Leon Noel: I was running and showing my way like look this is this is the future like this is.

1312
01:50:10,575 --> 01:50:14,398
Leon Noel: this is the thing that We need the most in the world right now.

1313
01:50:14,478 --> 01:50:17,800
Leon Noel: And so yeah, I'm super happy that that's like on your your vision.

1314
01:50:18,540 --> 01:50:19,782
Quincy Larson: Education wants to be free.

1315
01:50:20,142 --> 01:50:37,459
Leon Noel: Yeah, exactly like this is it right like doing the work like and like we said earlier I think free co-camp is amazing at identifying the real gaps like the things that people really need to be successful and Filling them and having a community that's willing to step up and do that work to fill those gaps.

1316
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:39,080
Leon Noel: so it's something I've.

1317
01:50:40,221 --> 01:50:42,642
Leon Noel: It's the reason why it's the best donation I make every single week.

1318
01:50:42,722 --> 01:50:50,485
Leon Noel: It's the reason why I always send folks to free code camps, because I know that they're in safe hands to get the things they need done.

1319
01:50:51,866 --> 01:50:53,607
Leon Noel: Free isn't free for everyone, right?

1320
01:50:53,627 --> 01:51:01,390
Leon Noel: In terms of time and commitment, a lot of folks that would be extremely successful at 100 devs, right?

1321
01:51:01,410 --> 01:51:10,251
Leon Noel: The cliche line is that Skill and talent is distributed, opportunity is not, right?

1322
01:51:10,291 --> 01:51:18,916
Leon Noel: And so we have a lot of folks that are extremely talented that could be phenomenal software engineers, but don't have the opportunity or the privilege of time.

1323
01:51:19,536 --> 01:51:20,617
Leon Noel: They need to take that time.

1324
01:51:20,657 --> 01:51:23,399
Leon Noel: they would be spending learning, driving for Uber.

1325
01:51:23,979 --> 01:51:24,920
Leon Noel: doing DoorDash.

1326
01:51:25,340 --> 01:51:28,503
Leon Noel: They need to take that time to put food on the table for their family.

1327
01:51:29,143 --> 01:51:38,731
Leon Noel: And when we polled our collective, we saw that folks really only needed around $200 a week to make this a viable pathway.

1328
01:51:39,211 --> 01:51:46,858
Leon Noel: So our huge, big goal is to build out an agency model where real companies come.

1329
01:51:47,518 --> 01:51:50,560
Leon Noel: They have work that they need for us to accomplish.

1330
01:51:50,881 --> 01:52:07,352
Leon Noel: We have super seasoned professional engineers that lead those projects, and then we break those projects down into individual issues or tasks, so that as you're learning, you're also maybe picking up some of these tasks in a real code base, like your skills become intensely practical.

1331
01:52:07,913 --> 01:52:21,243
Leon Noel: By the time you graduate or leave 100 Devs, you've built real projects for real companies with production level code, And all the money that comes into agency goes directly into those issues, so that you're also getting a little bit of money coming in as you're working through it.

1332
01:52:21,684 --> 01:52:29,810
Leon Noel: And we think that might make our program more equitable for folks that just don't have that last little bit of privilege of free time.

1333
01:52:29,870 --> 01:52:36,491
Leon Noel: And so Like I said, we talked about earlier, we're a group of people that run ahead first into really big audacious goals.

1334
01:52:36,531 --> 01:52:37,791
Leon Noel: Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

1335
01:52:37,811 --> 01:52:41,832
Leon Noel: We're going to have a lot of mistakes, a lot of things are going to go wrong, but we're going to figure it out.

1336
01:52:42,232 --> 01:52:52,135
Leon Noel: And our goal is that when we launch our next cohort, we also have this agency model in place as well, so that you're not only learning, but getting this practical paid experience as well.

1337
01:52:52,455 --> 01:52:53,316
Quincy Larson: Yeah, that's so cool.

1338
01:52:53,376 --> 01:52:54,076
Leon Noel: I mean, that's like

1339
01:52:55,097 --> 01:53:09,725
Quincy Larson: we're all about taking away excuses from people like it is in like to be fair, like a lot of excuses, like if you have young kids or you're taking care of your folks, if you're working like three jobs to be able to pay exorbitant rent in your city, you know, like those are very.

1340
01:53:10,754 --> 01:53:14,057
Quincy Larson: reasonable reasons for not being able to spend a lot of time coding.

1341
01:53:14,117 --> 01:53:23,904
Quincy Larson: But if there are things you can do to remove some of those barriers, to make it easier for people to commit to an already arduous process of learning to code, right?

1342
01:53:24,384 --> 01:53:30,869
Quincy Larson: And nobody, anybody who says learning to code is easy is trying to tell you something like, it is hard as heck.

1343
01:53:31,750 --> 01:53:32,811
Quincy Larson: It's getting easier every year.

1344
01:53:33,072 --> 01:53:34,193
Quincy Larson: We're not dealing with punch cards.

1345
01:53:34,393 --> 01:53:35,875
Quincy Larson: We're getting higher levels of abstraction.

1346
01:53:36,235 --> 01:53:39,259
Quincy Larson: It is becoming easier, but it's not Star Trek easy where you just talk to the computer, right?

1347
01:53:40,120 --> 01:53:43,343
Quincy Larson: Eventually it will be, but maybe in the 24th century.

1348
01:53:45,406 --> 01:53:49,808
Quincy Larson: The more immediate problem... helping people free up their time so they can actually learn.

1349
01:53:50,088 --> 01:53:53,028
Quincy Larson: I just want to commend you on this program.

1350
01:53:53,088 --> 01:54:08,151
Quincy Larson: Like, I love the idea of getting people out there doing real world work, getting compensation through some sort of program where they can just, I mean, even $200 a week, it sounds like it's going to be a huge lifeline for a lot of these folks and free up a lot of time and energy.

1351
01:54:09,692 --> 01:54:21,881
Quincy Larson: This is extremely exciting and I would be very excited to have you back on in the future to catch up and like, see what you learned from running this this new uh experiment that you're running this bold endeavor.

1352
01:54:22,742 --> 01:54:23,523
Leon Noel: i'll let you know how it goes.

1353
01:54:24,404 --> 01:54:24,825
Quincy Larson: awesome man.

1354
01:54:24,865 --> 01:54:36,719
Quincy Larson: well it's been such a joy learning so much from you not just from this conversation but just you know following you on twitter I'm going to add links to a lot of stuff that we've talked about in here.

1355
01:54:36,819 --> 01:54:38,940
Quincy Larson: I'm going to, of course, link to 100Devs.

1356
01:54:39,480 --> 01:54:54,348
Quincy Larson: And I just encourage people to learn more about the work of Leon, learn more about 100Devs, Resilient Coders, these organizations that, you know, like Resilient Coders is a charity, like Free Code Camp, 501C3.

1357
01:54:55,088 --> 01:55:01,012
Quincy Larson: And, you know, like there are lots of charities out there that are doing important work.

1358
01:55:01,992 --> 01:55:06,235
Quincy Larson: I'm going to try to encourage people to do what we've done, the two of us.

1359
01:55:06,776 --> 01:55:19,745
Quincy Larson: And yes, you can create a startup and make a lot of money and life-changing money, especially if you've got family that are back in a home country that needs support.

1360
01:55:19,865 --> 01:55:24,168
Quincy Larson: I will never give people a hard time about just wanting to make a whole lot of money.

1361
01:55:25,249 --> 01:55:38,646
Quincy Larson: If you have the means, if you are somebody who's mid-career and wants to do something in the charity space, I hope that the accomplishments of Leon and Modestly, Free Co-Camp, and the project that I...

1362
01:55:38,766 --> 01:55:39,707
Leon Noel: Not so Modestly.

1363
01:55:39,727 --> 01:55:41,830
Leon Noel: There's no Modesty that needs to be had there.

1364
01:55:42,170 --> 01:55:42,370
Quincy Larson: Yes.

1365
01:55:43,251 --> 01:55:50,435
