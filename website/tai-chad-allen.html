        <p>you brought some friends it's good to see you nice to meet you</p>

        <p>if this is your first time this is your first time on Twitch just go ahead and put in first time or first into chat for me please let's get used to using chat here folks but first if it's your first time there's no way that I'm paying attention to the to the subs or anything that right now I I want to see the first welcome</p>
        <p>glad you found us now how did you find us if you uh if you if you found this from Twitter give me a thumbs up in chat for me please you 00:04 found this from Twitter give me a thumbs up if you found us from Reddit give us a thumbs up</p>
        <p>hey we out here we ain't we ain't outside but we live we ain't outside but we live what's going on everybody we got a lot of fun stuff to get to tonight</p>
        <p>this is day one of a 30 week software engineering boot camp and we got a lot on the plate this evening we're going to take some time to get to know each other a little bit we're going to take some time to get to understand the opportunity that's in front of us we're going to talk a little bit about what it means to become a software engineer how you can actually do that we're going to talk about how to actually learn</p>
        <p>a lot of folks set on this path and they don't get to the end because they never actually learned how to learn so that's what we're starting tonight and then 00:05 we're going to get to some basics of HTML so we got a lot to a lot to get through</p>
        <p>now if you were on Discord which you all should be exclamation point Discord and chat if you're not on Discord there was a question and I always like to go live with a question enables me to get to know you a little bit</p>
        <p>see where folks lean and so the question today was would you rather have every movie that you watch slowly transition into Shrek or would you rather every song you listen to slowly transition into Allstar by Smashmouth now we got a lot of shrikes in here I don't think I've seen all right there we go I saw one all star that was It smash M be wild and recently I don't know if you saw some of the stuff they've been getting into but I think 00:06 Shrek might be the safer bet here</p>
        <p>all right we're good we got the Shrek folks in the house all right everybody welcome welcome welcome glad you found us glad you're here we're about to do this thing all right</p>
        <p>so before we dive too deep into actually learning tonight I want to take some time to explain why we're here what we're doing and hopefully that's what you signed up for so tonight we start a journey to becoming a software engineer by the end of class tomorrow you will be a software engineer</p>
        <p>let me say one more time you know what I'm going to go big Le on here let's let's get close by the end of class on Thursday 00:07 let's say Thursday Thursday sorry class Thursday by the end of class on Thursday you will be a software engineer</p>
        <p>you will all have written code now there are some some nerds in the bunch that are like well Leon just writing codes and not being a software engineer knock it off if you can write code you understand the systems and tools behind the code that you're writing and you conduct yourself as a professional you're going to call yourself a software engineer</p>

        <p>we're going to have some haters that are are going to disagree with us but them what we're here to do today is to lay that foundation so that by the end of 30 weeks not only you a software engineer not only have you gotten paid clients not only have you built tons of real projects sunk a 100 hours into a fully custom project of your own not only have you contributed to open source 00:08 but you are fully prepared to enter the workforce as a software engineer right out the gate</p>
        <p>I'm going to tell you one thing that I hope sinks in today don't get got we go get we don't get got we go get exactly</p>
        <p>one thing that I hope sinks in today and that learning to code is a journey but you can do it</p>
        <p>I've seen folks from all walks of life all shapes sizes shades Creeds do it so I honestly believe in my heart of hearts you can do it but learning to code is not enough we're going to talk about that later today learning to code is not the only thing in fact it's a small part of what it takes to get a job and so we're going to talk about the whole journey the way that you go from maybe just figuring out if this is the career for you to actually Landing that 00:09 job and this isn't our first rodeo folks this is cohort 2</p>
        <p>our last cohort saw 75 folks get jobs yes I know Leon you said 70 you said 72 in the Tweet well guess what I got three more for y'all I got three more for y'all uh so we're at 75</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>now now that journey is a long difficult Journey but we're going to get there together if you just turn off the screen and you never listen to me again here's you need a community</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>if you're going to learn how to code you need a community when you get stuck and something doesn't make sense you don't give up you go to your community</p>
        <p>what we built in the last cohort is hands down the best community 00:10 to learn code live online and we're going to keep it that way so if this isn't for you and you still want to learn how to code that's fine</p>
        <p>find your people find your community but what we have is an amazing one and you're seeing it in chat right now</p>
        <p>we got a lot of new folks with us tonight we got a lot of old folks too we got a lot of alumni folks that already put in those Blood Sweat</p>
        <p>and Tears to get their jobs but they're coming back because they want you to be successful mentors that want you to be successful folks that have walked this walk have talked that talk and now want to help you do the same thing</p>
        <p>there's a lot of you I love seeing it all right before we get too deep into it uh you're noticing a few things happening here uh there are these these sub notifications that are going off uh that</p>
        <p>the goal of this boot camp is for you to go from zero experience to a job with paying 0 I will never even recommend a book a course a tutorial that is not free right now there's a window open folks my there is a window open and in 00:12 this window you can become a software engineer for free and without a degree and I want to help you on that Journey</p>
